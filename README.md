
# Ultra Smart Rasa Chatbot

An intelligent, AI-powered chatbot generated from a CSV file. This project uses machine learning to cluster intents and generate a production-ready Rasa setup.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ & pip
- A `Conversation.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

### 1. Installation
Install the required Python libraries for your chatbot:
```bash
pip install rasa
```

### 2. Train the Model
Navigate into your generated project folder (`cd rasa_chatbot`) and train the Rasa model:
```bash
rasa train
```

### 3. Run the Chatbot
Start the Rasa server (this bot does not require a separate action server):
```bash
rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*"
```

### 4. Talk to Your Bot
Open a new terminal and use the shell to chat:
```bash
rasa shell
```
