# Intent Recognition Project

This project focuses on building and deploying an intent recognition system. The goal is to classify user queries or text into predefined intents, which is a common task in natural language understanding (NLU) for chatbots, virtual assistants, or intelligent systems.

## Project Files

* `app.py`: This is likely the main application file, possibly a Flask or Streamlit application, that provides an interface for interacting with the intent recognition model. It might handle user input, pass it to the model, and display the predicted intent.
* `intent.csv`: This CSV file most probably contains the dataset used for training the intent recognition model. It's expected to have columns for text input (e.g., user utterances) and their corresponding intent labels.
* `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries and their specific versions that are required to run `app.py` and any other scripts within this project. It ensures a reproducible and consistent development environment.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the main application:

```bash
python app.py
