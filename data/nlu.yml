    \ tomorrow.\n- are there going to be layoffs at this place?\n- that's nice, but\
    \ tell me what she looks like.\n- it was the best game ever.\n- to thank him and\
    \ all the other soldiers who served in world war ii.\n- you might be right.\n\

    \ the volume.\n- maybe the banana was bad.\n- they call him father dollar bill.\n\
    - i'm not. i just want to know.\n- do you have any other skills?\n- i didn't have\
    \ to. it's been in business for 60 years.\n- a puddle of water is very dangerous.\n\
    - thank you. i just bought these new shoes earlier today.\n- after that, we can\

    \ always liked to draw and paint.\n- can i pick you up friday night?\n- i'll hold\
    \ you to that.\n- no, i had no idea.\n- your driver's license and registration,\
    \ please.\n- are there any hobbies you do?\n- but we just got here.\n- it starts\
    \ at 8 o'clock.\n- it doesn't look very nice outside today.\n- that's it?\n- maybe\
    \ he'll send us our waiter immediately.\n- that's not the attitude of a good driver.\n\
    - i couldn't help laughing, either.\n- no. it costs too much money.\n- that's\
    \ not nice.\n- so?\n- i've tried everything, but nothing works.\n- but it was\
    \ full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?\n- then we went to a jazz club.\n\
    - i will poke your eyes out.\n- you have to change their diapers.\n- number five,\

    - it looks like it may rain soon.\n- tell me what you've been up to.\n- i could\
    \ pick only one or the other?\n- we'll be here forever.\n- so what are you going\
    \ to do?\n- he had cigarettes, but no battery.\n- now he's slowing down.\n- so,\
    \ i'll just buy another one.\n- i washed the sheets and towels.\n- you like to\
    \ see it disappear.\n- so, what do we do?\n- so are mine.\n- me too. it always\
    \ smells so fresh after it rains.\n- to try something new and exciting.\n- a man\
    \ i met in a coffee shop.\n- sure. why not?\n- any rain right now would be pointless.\n\
    - do you get pbs on tv?\n- i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.\n- i bought\
    \ it on a hunch.\n- your nose is stopped up?\n- i've heard about it, but i'm still\

    - does god answer your prayers?\n- remember to put air in your tires.\n- has anyone\
    \ told you about jessica's party coming up?\n- i mixed them together.\n- so what's\
    \ the problem?\n- i haven't decided yet.\n- it's too much like other flags.\n\
    - they added phony charges to our bill.\n- our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette\
    \ smoke.\n- there's something wrong with my right hand.\n- buy a new one.\n- i'm\
    \ sorry. i'm already doing something this friday.\n- we tell our students to leave\
    \ the classroom.\n- you're sitting there with your mouth open.\n- i don't mean\
    \ good-looking. i mean good-smelling.\n- i had to take my friend to the airport.\n\
    - it's six years old.\n- you can't see the end of it.\n- it should be warmer in\
    \ a few minutes.\n- there will be another show next week.\n- i wish my eyes were\
    \ blue.\n- i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.\n- i'm going to have to\
    \ say that superbad is the best movie ever.\n- i can't do that.\n- i never thought\
    \ about that.\n- my waist is bigger than it was.\n- it's such a chore.\n- that's\
    \ nice.\n- without gravity, the water would go up.\n- so it's not worth much?\n\
    - i didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.\n- all we've seen so far is a couple\
    \ of lizards.\n- but you're doing 75.\n- tell me how she looks.\n- debrah already\
    \ had her baby.\n- i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter.\n- it's\
    \ almost empty.\n- do they help you run faster?\n- or you'll hear the collision\
    \ if someone doesn't stop.\n- beer is a powerful drug.\n- all it takes is will\
    \ power, and you have it.\n- a little cigarette controls them.\n- is it raining\
    \ right now?\n- no more homework.\n- do you know why?\n- i'll get her a nice card.\n\

    \ meat every day.\n- and carry it into the house.\n- i am going to see a movie\
    \ with a friend of mine. what about you?\n- maybe you shouldn't eat there again.\n\
    - no one believes that the crime rate is going down.\n- for example, if your birth\

    - well, my english isn't perfect.\n- i missed you too.\n- that sounds like a great\
    \ job.\n- but what if i'm a fish in my next life?\n- they are so weak.\n- let's\
    \ go to the lake.\n- but, mom!\n- i can't read my book.\n- parking at school is\
    \ impossible.\n- a good gun costs $400 or more.\n- well, i know how to flip hamburgers.\n\

    \ all year round.\n- that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon.\n- tell her\
    \ i said hello.\n- the husband said he tried to help the boy.\n- the first thing\
    \ i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.\n- they like guys with new cars.\n-\
    \ uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.\n- bluedog123 is just the street.\
    \ you have to give me the city, state, and zip code.\n- i was writing a letter.\n\
    - you started eating ice cream?\n- no one would hire you to flip hamburgers.\n\

    \ change the light bulb. it burnt out.\n- i can't believe how long this line is.\n\
    - it was like the real thing.\n- but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.\n- paper\
    \ is flying everywhere.\n- it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right\
    \ now.\n- i may know which girl you're talking about.\n- they trust in god.\n\
    - even though they're in black and white.\n- maybe i left the burner on.\n- the\
    \ pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.\n- but the title of measure\

    \ it, too.\n- about what?\n- i couldn't wait. it was an emergency.\n- well, a\
    \ d is better than an f.\n- i was told about it already. i'm just waiting for\
    \ my invitation.\n- it's getting later every minute.\n- well, just call the front\
    \ desk. they'll give us new sheets.\n- nothing seems to work.\n- that's hard to\
    \ take.\n- if they are all outside, then what?\n- have you met the new girl?\n\
    - and then will she look normal again?\n- i just wanted to give you the good news.\n\
    - boy, that is a good nose.\n- so what were you calling me about?\n- not if we\
    \ save every penny.\n- yikes! what was that noise?\n- but you would buy her cd\
    \ if she was pretty?\n- will it be good beach weather?\n- i was thinking about\
    \ seeing a movie.\n- do you like it there?\n- that would be fun.\n- are you sure?\n\
    - i've never been to a french restaurant.\n- i want to cruise to hawaii.\n- you're\

    \ start dinner at 6:00.\n- i'm having dinner with my family\n- i went to the market\
    \ yesterday.\n- it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.\n- there were\
    \ more votes than voters!\n- against all of them, of course.\n- he shouldn't scuba\
    \ dive until he retires.\n- well, listen to it more quietly.\n- open the book.\n\
    - not that i've noticed.\n- i like listening to different kinds of music.\n- considering\
    \ that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.\n- not much.\n-\
    \ they're behind the outfield.\n- he's a famous artist.\n- it only took about\
    \ two hours.\n- you should loosen your belt.\n- that would be weird.\n- that's\

    \ barbara.\n- it got rained out.\n- that was mean to say.\n- i got ripped off.\n\
    - so, you didn't become a doctor.\n- well, it's one of them.\n- but the same thing\
    \ day after day gets old.\n- basically, i've been working too.\n- thank you.\n\
    - i'd like that.\n- it sounds like it will be.\n- is there a reason why?\n- i'm\
    \ going to dinner with my family.\n- so it's better to save money than to have\
    \ an honest election?\n- the internet is amazing.\n- are your nails clean?\n-\
    \ i like a good story.\n- i will rub gently but firmly.\n- i haven't looked anywhere\

    \ books.\n- is that right? why?\n- i thought you had an elephant in your house.\n\
    - it's my mom's dog.\n- i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.\n- that's\
    \ only a penny a minute!\n- pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.\n\
    - no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.\n- that sounds wonderful.\n\
    - well, you're supposed to be working.\n- i can't believe how hot it is.\n- i'm\
    \ sorry for you.\n- take me to a nice restaurant, not to mcdonald's.\n- she told\
    \ him to drop his girlfriend.\n- my back is killing me.\n- well, he can enjoy\
    \ it while it lasts.\n- a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\
    - still, it's safer than florida.\n- i'll call you later.\n- i have a little poodle.\n\
    - i went to the beach every day.\n- especially if it's the same work, over and\
    \ over.\n- you need a bath every day.\n- have you gone to school today?\n- our\

    - they didn't say.\n- because you helped make it dirty.\n- he wanted to take it\
    \ home yesterday.\n- is that right?\n- of course. he stops the fastest cars.\n\
    - that's what i thought.\n- then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings\
    \ you the new steak.\n- they should look good, too.\n- you can wear this one around\
    \ the house.\n- spring break starts tomorrow.\n- is it something you ate?\n- the\
    \ invitation says it starts at 8:00 p.m.\n- i'll do that in a minute.\n- and then\

    - i have no idea.\n- the tv news is reporting a bank robbery.\n- we never have\
    \ to call the police about anything.\n- do you like it?\n- but big earthquakes\

    \ you.\n- ask the clerk.\n- hey, what's good with you?\n- that's my perfume.\n\
    - and the government will give you a fourth story.\n- but when i sneak just one\
    \ cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!\n- bluedog123. are\

    \ fruit that is too ripe?\n- $1,000.\n- then we can scrub it with a wet sponge\
    \ and soap.\n- a gardening show follows a knitting show.\n- the usual, cereal\
    \ with milk and a banana.\n- so am i.\n- anything else?\n- this is a nice neighborhood.\n\
    - you're probably right, do you intend on going to the party?\n- no. that will\
    \ cost too much money.\n- my parents are divorced.\n- boy, it's chilly outside,\

    \ interesting lawsuits.\n- you can travel all over the world.\n- do you have a\
    \ car?\n- then you flew back home that evening?\n- me, too. school was fun.\n\
    - you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.\n- i guess so.\n- look at\
    \ the car chase on tv!\n- but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99\
    \ cents.\n- and i want to get a big cabin with a view.\n- maybe we can go see\
    \ a movie or something.\n- you had an art class?\n- out of every movie that you've\
    \ seen, which one is your favorite?\n- life is hard.\n- and grow a beard?\n- they\
    \ were about forty dollars.\n- i wish i was free that night. i'm kind of mad that\
    \ i didn't go.\n- look at these marks on my arms.\n- i like this restaurant because\
    \ they give you free bread.\n- maybe i should see a doctor.\n- that's a good reason\
    \ to like something.\n- i will play the radio as loud as i want.\n- you know what\
    \ that means.\n- no, it's too close to the kitchen door.\n- i've been missing\
    \ you like crazy.\n- yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.\n- i got divorced\
    \ two years ago.\n- no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october.\n\

    \ the bears.\n- are you going to college?\n- \"\xC2\u2026and you know you should\
    \ be glad!\"\n- i hope we'll see a home run.\n- your wallet is empty?\n- i wish\
    \ i could move here.\n- no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.\n- i'm not\
    \ voting for the mayor.\n- because you need variety.\n- no. it's in southern california.\n\
    - i drove around for half an hour.\n- i bought some stock.\n- oh. that's not good.\n\
    - well, i can always pull over.\n- and lots of books.\n- you get to put someone\
    \ in power that you like.\n- he didn't give you any medication?\n- that's a great\
    \ price.\n- actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.\n- tv news is so\
    \ stupid.\n- tell me you're joking.\n- just ask her out to dinner.\n- you can\
    \ help me.\n- my brother smokes three packs a day.\n- yesterday, a woman complained\
    \ about a cell phone she bought on ebay.\n- i'm going to the movies with a friend.\
    \ how about you?\n- i enjoy the different types of instruments that they use.\n\
    - \"she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!...\"\n- the streets and sidewalks are clean.\n\
    - would you like to go to dinner or something?\n- it doesn't work.\n- that sounds\
    \ like fun.\n- but work goes on forever!\n- it's about crime in los angeles.\n\
    - have you heard from them?\n- i started shopping at the dollar store.\n- no problem.\
    \ so how have you been?\n- i sure do.\n- you should be happy, not worried.\n-\

    \ have blue eyes.\n- it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.\n- well, she'll\
    \ probably just give me my invitation later on today.\n- that sounds like a dream\
    \ job.\n- i want to get a puppy for my son.\n- while you're using the bathroom,\
    \ i'll order some food.\n- they always tell us \"what's next.\"\n- i saw you looking\
    \ at that woman.\n- of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into\
    \ your house.\n- let's go out to eat.\n- so maybe we better leave at 8:15?\n-\
    \ no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.\n- but he's supposed to be making our\
    \ city a better place.\n- the officer said the red hand was blinking.\n- no, we\
    \ won't have money for gas or food.\n- i said i have to go to the bathroom.\n\
    - this is such a long light.\n- you might want to buy a pair.\n- stress causes\
    \ your stomachaches?\n- because a puppy costs money.\n- i'm going to take a nap.\n\
    - one or two tires were cut on each car.\n- they will drop the new steak on the\
    \ floor, step on it, and then spit on it.\n- i thought they were playing under\
    \ a dome.\n- old movies are the best.\n- and it's not too small.\n- then you can\
    \ wipe your seat and window.\n- at 8:00 p.m.\n- actors didn't curse back then.\n\
    - this is a huge library.\n- have you taken anything for your cold?\n- i like\
    \ living here.\n- i bet you had to drag him away.\n- you mean i will smell the\
    \ food cooking?\n- i got a promotion at my job.\n- the score was 101-98.\n- it\
    \ sure is.\n- i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.\n- you're driving\
    \ too fast.\n- because of all the earthquakes and fires.\n- i would never want\
    \ to be president.\n- sounds like it was a close game.\n- i wonder if i should\
    \ bring my gloves.\n- they are clean, too.\n- your day was just like mine.\n-\
    \ me too.\n- i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.\n- yes. we want to\

    - i hate shaving.\n- of course, the cheese with holes in it.\n- i can't stand\
    \ cigarette smoke.\n- i agree.\n- i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.\n\
    - so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.\n- no, this is the tree.\n- sure.\
    \ why do you need it?\n- i have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite\
    \ to be nosey.\n- i'm going to be a teacher.\n- well, she's quite short.\n- you\
    \ haven't told me anything yet.\n- i meet too many jerks.\n- no, i'm serious.\n\

    \ means it will get hotter.\n- she laughed! she didn't believe me.\n- can we get\
    \ tickets?\n- good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.\n- my bad, i had\
    \ chores to do.\n- you're wearing out your right hand. stop using it so much.\n\
    - and a puppy eats food. food costs money.\n- i wish i had never started.\n- a\

    \ me.\n- oh, no. i forgot.\n- i'm serious. you deserved this promotion.\n- my\

    - and the pickles were great, too.\n- well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.\n\

    \ been a close game.\n- some men do, but not me.\n- she would laugh at me.\n-\
    \ i have to go back upstairs.\n- i would say she's only five feet.\n- everyone\
    \ tells you a different story about the same thing.\n- i'm not quite sure yet.\n\
    - no. that's incomplete.\n- only about $30,000.\n- without the peanut butter!\n\

    \ i hate homework.\n- the sandwich was good, too.\n- and a one-pound tub of soft\
    \ butter was the same price.\n- me too. i want to play for the yankees.\n- he\
    \ hates democrats and republicans.\n- that's what i do.\n- the stars look so much\
    \ closer after it rains.\n- then they're worth every penny.\n- i can't quit, because\
    \ i'm making a good salary.\n- i live in pasadena.\n- especially for drivers of\
    \ big trucks.\n- i've been good. i'm in school right now.\n- hopefully it will.\n\

    \ in school?\n- the seats and windows are dirty.\n- the cat doesn't care about\
    \ anything.\n- well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.\n\

    \ the girl.\n- i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.\n- and lots\
    \ of thieves.\n- you got up real early.\n- i'll put a glove in each pocket.\n\
    - there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?\n- is it easy to learn?\n\

    - no, a real breakfast.\n- i like all my classmates, too.\n- i folded all the\
    \ towels.\n- i thought you had a job.\n- just you?\n- or you'll see the collision\

    \ the entire house.\n- i have a stomachache.\n- i'll help you.\n- i want to be\
    \ a baseball player when i grow up.\n- that's exactly how i felt.\n- i know, it\
    \ does sound pretty awesome.\n- just lettuce, tomato, and celery.\n- this year\
    \ he gave away $15,000.\n- maybe we're here to have fun.\n- does it have a price\
