    \ cheese in my salads.\n- and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.\n\
    - i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.\n- i didn't want to, so i didn't.\n\
    - i was told about it already. i'm just waiting for my invitation.\n- and it was\
    \ only 12 years.\n- i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset.\n\
    - my brother smokes three packs a day.\n- use a tissue next time.\n- that's a\
    \ great price.\n- maybe the milk was bad.\n- and it's just as easy to prepare.\n\
    - and now i'm glad that i didn't.\n- read the phone number to me.\n- so, what's\
    \ the problem?\n- because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.\n-\
    \ i wish it would cool off one day.\n- i understand. rain does make it smell cleaner.\n\
    - boy, i'm glad that job is finished.\n- he drew two butterflies and a flower\
    \ on a napkin in a restaurant.\n- i sure hope so.\n- it's not orange!\n- never\
    \ better, thanks.\n- well, there is one good table.\n- the invitation says it\
    \ starts at 8:00 p.m.\n- no more homework.\n- golf is a silly game.\n- \"mi\"\
    \ stands for middle initial.\n- i saw it twelve times.\n- maybe i left the burner\
    \ on.\n- it's the funniest movie that i've ever seen.\n- i hope we'll catch a\
    \ foul ball.\n- i lost my new pen.\n- i'm trying to stretch my dollars.\n- i hate\
    \ flying.\n- she weighs 98 pounds.\n- well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess\
    \ it's okay to eat here.\n- some of it is okay, i guess.\n- i can't get a single\
    \ channel.\n- seriously, i am so excited.\n- room service brought us a cold dinner.\n\
    - is pasadena a big city?\n- is there a reason why?\n- so the cop will stop those\
    \ cars?\n- that's what i thought.\n- i started school recently.\n- so why are\
    \ we selling our house?\n- i have a honda.\n- tv news is so stupid.\n- my bad,\
    \ i had chores to do.\n- but we have the same old problems.\n- i use a calling\
    \ card.\n- a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.\n- it only took about\
    \ two hours.\n- a dentist, i'm sure.\n- are there more fish or more people?\n\
    - i was crossing the street.\n- old movies are the best.\n- there sure are\xC2\
    \u2014at least a million.\n- shots for what?\n- well, my english isn't perfect.\n\
    - here he comes now.\n- is that it?\n- no, but that was a random change of subject.\n\
    - for me, it's the students.\n- it sure is.\n- are there fish at the bottom?\n\
    - okay, my seatbelt is on.\n- a tree fell onto my dad's car.\n- so go then.\n\
    - that's not good.\n- i wonder if i should bring my gloves.\n- it's a little bitter,\
    \ but it's okay.\n- i'll go up front and talk to the manager.\n- can we afford\
    \ it?\n- that would be weird.\n- that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not\
    \ living people.\n- i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas,\
    \ the apples, and the oranges.\n- so does mine.\n- hmm, that's not bad.\n- number\
    \ four, it's too crowded.\n- oh, no, it isn't!\n- boiled? i never heard of that.\n\
    - i can't spend four hours on the road every day.\n- look! he just got out of\
    \ the car and started running.\n- it was new in 2003.\n- a movie sounds good.\n\
    - i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years.\n- i sprinkled salt and pepper\
    \ on the food before i tasted it.\n- it's got a big yard.\n- i'll have to try\
    \ them sometime.\n- i see that former president bush is at a conference.\n- our\
    \ cousin went into labor and had her baby last week.\n- i'm eating so much bread\
    \ that i'm getting full.\n- it is delicious, especially with butter.\n- my wife\
    \ and i will be cremated.\n- my mother was hurt and angry.\n- and it's deep, too.\n\
    - i'm sorry, i can't.\n- the husband said he tried to help the boy.\n- that sounds\
    \ good.\n- sunday means we go to church.\n- good luck with that.\n- he's rude\
    \ and he yells a lot.\n- bring me a better steak.\n- i can add two and two.\n\
    - yikes! what was that noise?\n- let's turn on the heat.\n- the worst in the whole\
    \ world.\n- i honestly didn't know.\n- that's a good question. maybe it's not\
    \ old age.\n- no, i haven't.\n- let's go to an early movie.\n- but no one knows\
    \ for sure.\n- it's one dollar for 100 minutes.\n- with toast, ham, sausage, fresh\
    \ fruit, and juice.\n- no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm\
    \ pretty hungry right now.\n- it's on the tip of my finger.\n- that's a good price.\n\
    - well, he's made a few changes.\n- at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious.\n\
    - he changed the game.\n- i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.\n\
    - he said he wasn't using drugs.\n- my back is killing me.\n- then go find a tissue\
    \ in the bathroom.\n- anyway, i have to fix the hole.\n- then why aren't i having\
    \ fun?\n- yes, but the red hand was blinking.\n- i just peeled it, and i'm looking\
    \ at it right now.\n- neither can i.\n- i was writing a letter.\n- that's true.\
    \ it is a very funny movie.\n- then why is there mud on the carpet?\n- me too.\
    \ i want to play for the yankees.\n- i got a promotion at my job.\n- and then\
    \ we can go to my home.\n- i ate free cheese and meat every day.\n- oh, no. that's\
    \ bad news.\n- i watched it once. that was enough.\n- we haven't been in a month.\n\
    - i'm calling the waiter.\n- that was a huge fire in santa barbara.\n- i have\
    \ to get off the phone now.\n- that's a good deal.\n- i never miss the food and\
    \ drink section.\n- a travel show follows another travel show.\n- clean the sink,\
    \ the tub, the counter, and the toilet.\n- my dad had to buy a new car.\n- it's\
    \ about crime in los angeles.\n- well, it won't last forever.\n- she's not too\
    \ tall.\n- i didn't know that.\n- doesn't that get old?\n- but the swine flu just\
    \ killed 20 people in mexico.\n- i want to buy lunch.\n- i have to clean the house.\n\
    - me too. i can't wait until winter.\n- well, she's quite short.\n- oh, well,\
    \ it only cost me a dollar.\n- well, i guess that's it.\n- i saw it eight times.\n\
    - there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.\n- three bedrooms, three\
    \ bathrooms, and a big back yard.\n- it seems fine to me.\n- okay, let's sit down.\n\
    - take me to dinner.\n- i hope that it does rain.\n- did he understand what the\
    \ problem is?\n- i toss and turn all night.\n- i'm a handyman.\n- it leaves at\
    \ 12:15.\n- but that's what pockets are for.\n- i could pick only one or the other?\n\
    - a pc or a mac?\n- there's no food in the woods.\n- so what was the score?\n\
    - i mean i have wonderful students.\n- the book is open.\n- is that right. who\
    \ ended up winning?\n- he's the only candidate that i trust.\n- now he has the\
    \ world record!\n- some people have good noses.\n- i bought lots of oranges and\
    \ apples.\n- did someone steal it?\n- i hope i win the lotto.\n- i enjoy listening\
    \ to all kinds of music.\n- number five, it's unsafe.\n- i already loosened my\
    \ belt and unbuttoned my pants.\n- has she given out a lot of invitations yet?\n\
    - the sandwich was good, too.\n- no, the car stopped and the passenger pushed\
    \ the injured student off the hood.\n- housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.\n\
    - he's a famous artist.\n- it's the best job i've ever had.\n- i'm not being nosey.\
    \ i'm just asking.\n- let's go out to eat.\n- okay, i give up.\n- i do too. that\
    \ way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.\n- do animals talk to\
    \ each other?\n- because i watch the other players.\n- one that won't grow up\
    \ too big.\n- tell me about it, dad.\n- he probably won't use drugs anymore.\n\
    - he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.\n\
    - we tell our students to leave the classroom.\n- look at the car chase on tv!\n\
    - i'm sorry, but i have to go.\n- he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling.\n\
    - especially on these slick floors.\n- a tutor helped me get the d!\n- our tv\
    \ remote is filthy.\n- he's a chain smoker.\n- the speed limit is 65.\n- i always\
    \ read the film reviews.\n- every time we eat out, it's an adventure.\n- just\
    \ boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.\n- i had to take my\
    \ friend to the airport.\n- yelling doesn't do any good.\n- i shook it. there\
    \ is no more ink.\n- that sounds wonderful.\n- that's it? that's all i have to\
    \ do?\n- yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation.\n- a girl i met at the\
    \ market.\n- rude people are everywhere.\n- shake it a couple of times.\n- i'll\
    \ make an appointment tomorrow.\n- i guess he has to be very careful about what\
    \ he eats.\n- i had a car problem, so i went online.\n- but the smell is different.\n\
    - i switched from pasta to potatoes.\n- and the rooms are clean, too.\n- but 90\
    \ percent of the world uses pcs.\n- i liked it.\n- we'll be eating peanut butter\
    \ sandwiches?\n- and the pickles were great, too.\n- it aches most of the time.\n\
    - well, i want to see \"the pursuit of happyness.\"\n- maybe he'll send us our\
    \ waiter immediately.\n- so? that's a ticket?\n- i had no idea.\n- i'll get the\
    \ yellow pages for an eye doctor.\n- but bush visited some of them in the hospital\
    \ once.\n- it's only a couple of feet.\n- i enjoy rock and r&b.\n- and he poured\
    \ water into our glasses.\n- i loved it. i still remember how amazing it was.\n\
    - no human could possibly play golf that well.\n- but the show will be over.\n\
    - our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.\n- i never used to buy swiss cheese.\n\
    - officials said that it's possible.\n- i'm not quite sure yet.\n- okay, i'll\
    \ get the vacuum cleaner.\n- i will have a radio in every room of my house.\n\
    - did he crash?\n- only about $30,000.\n- it should be warmer in a few minutes.\n\
    - i got a ticket downtown for $140.\n- is it beautiful?\n- the internet is amazing.\n\
    - worried about what?\n- to the state or the city?\n- so, what do we do?\n- oh,\
    \ yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.\n- yeah.\
    \ it's a lot of fun to slide.\n- no good movies come to mind.\n- no one speaks\
    \ perfect english.\n- oh, no. i forgot.\n- it's probably around somewhere.\n-\
    \ i'll start dinner at 6:00.\n- i had to bring work home with me.\n- she has light\
    \ brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.\n- i bought some new shoes.\n- it's worse\
    \ than that.\n- maybe the banana was bad.\n- my girlfriend's mom got mad at me\
    \ at the dinner table.\n- only 15 percent of the voters turned out.\n- i would\
    \ if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.\n- is there a game tonight?\n\
    - she's kind of short.\n- some people would just pick it up.\n- no, i had no idea.\n\
    - a ham sandwich.\n- i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.\n- no.\
    \ that's incomplete.\n- so does every smoker.\n- i hate shaving.\n- so what's\
    \ the problem?\n- let me get the keys.\n- no rusty old cars are sitting in the\
    \ front yards.\n- is that right? why?\n- i'll check to make sure that all the\
    \ windows are shut.\n- all i get is a black screen.\n- maybe i will be the first!\n\
    - the cops finally found the husband.\n- it gets worse every year.\n- tomorrow\
    \ we'll have rice and fish for lunch.\n- i have to feed them.\n- and ruth was\
    \ a good person, too.\n- a mad dog bit most of her face off.\n- everybody loves\
    \ pizza.\n- i'll just use the atm.\n- he might say i'm okay.\n- everybody buys\
    \ stock.\n- i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself.\n\
    - did he get off the hood?\n- that driver is crazy.\n- no. the bedbugs in that\
    \ mattress bit me.\n- that takes some time.\n- i'm having a party next saturday.\n\
    - no, thanks. i already took some medicine.\n- i know, it would be horrible if\
    \ it rained and it was hot outside.\n- oh, why is that?\n- maybe he had a good\
    \ reason.\n- brush, brush. spit, spit.\n- it's pretty big.\n- it was, until one\
    \ day my manager caught me.\n- exactly, it was my favorite class.\n- a coffin\
    \ costs too much and takes up too much space.\n- okay. teach me how to play.\n\
    - she's probably about five feet.\n- people are always getting up to use the bathroom.\n\
    - an andy warhol drawing.\n- last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.\n- no,\
    \ i hate vegetables.\n- after that, we can dry it with a towel.\n- i wish i was\
    \ free that night. i'm kind of mad that i didn't go.\n- a new hotel is looking\
    \ for workers.\n- a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.\n- it's\
    \ so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.\n- he had cigarettes, but no battery.\n\
    - that was mean to say.\n- well, nobody else does, so why should i?\n- that means\
    \ we have to leave the house at 9:15.\n- i haven't looked anywhere yet.\n- well,\
    \ a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.\n- but that's what most people do.\n\
    - i've been pretty busy myself.\n- i would say she's only five feet.\n- the score\
    \ was 101-98.\n- and then i made lunch.\n- that was an odd change of subject.\n\
    - i stayed home because i wasn't feeling well.\n- i warned her about her new boyfriend.\
    \ she didn't listen to me.\n- we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on\
    \ main street.\n- four hours, without a break.\n- i was unable to make it.\n-\
    \ not me. i want to play for the dodgers.\n- i mean, it's just coffee.\n- he's\
    \ a good speaker.\n- ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.\n\
    - it's close to the freeways.\n- i already looked there.\n- oh. that's simple\
    \ enough.\n- i'm pretty good. thanks for asking.\n- the speed limit is 65!\n-\
    \ the people are friendly.\n- yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.\n\
    - see those stains?\n- i wish my eyes were blue.\n- no, it isn't. he almost died\
    \ when he was little.\n- i'm upset with my mom.\n- same as ever, by mail. all\
    \ it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.\n- boy, that is a good nose.\n- but i stopped!\n\
    - did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?\n- every so often, i do.\n\
    - i can't do that.\n- just ask her out to dinner.\n- he shouldn't scuba dive until\
    \ he retires.\n- that's a bad day.\n- i want it to cool down some.\n- well, i\
    \ have to go back upstairs anyway.\n- it was the best game ever.\n- that means\
    \ it will get hotter.\n- no, please tell me.\n- it's called poker.\n- well, that's\
    \ between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.\n- all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.\n\
    - i went to the beach every day.\n- i meet too many jerks.\n- i'll rinse the car\
    \ first.\n- i listen day and night.\n- i stood on the great wall and looked all\
    \ around.\n- if i smelled bad, i could smell me.\n- i certainly hope not!\n- i\
    \ hope i come back as a cat.\n- maybe we're here to have fun.\n- it puts me to\
    \ sleep.\n- she's got a great personality.\n- i'm looking in the newspaper for\
    \ a job.\n- sorry about that. i was cleaning up.\n- well, the tables and chairs\
    \ look okay.\n- one or two tires were cut on each car.\n- she's about five feet\
    \ even.\n- oh. that's not good.\n- he moved out of our house.\n- only a threat?\n\
    - he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.\n- wow! that's terrible.\n- paper cuts\
    \ can hurt a lot.\n- i had the worst date the other night.\n- but i'm worried\
    \ about tiger.\n- i appreciate that.\n- my parents are divorced.\n- he's the best\
    \ man for president.\n- only if my candidate wins.\n- then we went to a jazz club.\n\
    - no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.\n- i hate to fly.\n- that\
    \ means it gets twice as much traffic.\n- three packs of what?\n- well, it's good\
    \ and bad.\n- i've tried to quit so many times.\n- the beatles are the best.\n\
    - maybe four or five pounds?\n- i wish it was a nicer day today.\n- i've never\
    \ been to a french restaurant.\n- that's exactly how i felt.\n- open the book.\n\
    - i go to pcc.\n- well, someone brought it into the house.\n- no, i never did.\
    \ all i know is that i got a's and b's in school.\n- we'll grow old together.\n\
    - it got rained out.\n- that's not right!\n- i pour lots of french dressing on\
    \ top.\n- turn the radio down, please.\n- sunday is mother's day.\n- maybe. i'm\
    \ not sure.\n- well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.\n\
    - i want to get a puppy for my son.\n- i've also been busy.\n- is it in northern\
    \ california?\n- forget it. go straight.\n- we should stand here till the clean-up\
    \ person gets here.\n- and then we can turn right at the light.\n- it's the middle\
    \ of summer, it shouldn't rain today.\n- that was a mistake.\n- that's a switch.\n\
    - that's a lot.\n- he spoke to them and made them feel better.\n- okay, let's\
    \ go see a movie.\n- i'm in a hurry.\n- thanks. i found these new shoes earlier\
    \ at the store.\n- i'll keep my receipt and my gun.\n- i didn't have a tissue.\n\
    - that's such a hassle.\n- i've been to two doctors.\n- then he didn't bother\
    \ to apologize.\n- no, he said he gently placed the boy on the street.\n- these\
    \ are chucks.\n- sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.\n- the tv news\
    \ is reporting a bank robbery.\n- we get a free breakfast.\n- look in the fridge.\n\
    - that's my perfume.\n- no, a real breakfast.\n- let's play cards.\n- i understand,\
    \ i guess.\n- life is hard.\n- he made promises that he didn't keep.\n- she would\
    \ laugh at me.\n- no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.\n- that's a\
    \ great idea.\n- every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.\n- stress\
    \ causes different problems with different people.\n- maybe she's different.\n\
    - i'm not sleeping on that sheet.\n- yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees\
    \ outside.\n- one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.\n- it's common sense.\n\
    - i haven't even lost one pound of fat?\n- life isn't fair.\n- then i did my laundry.\n\
    - i didn't say that.\n- it's an ugly day today.\n- tell me how she looks.\n- it's\
    \ a lot better than paying someone $60.\n- does it have a price tag?\n- a gardening\
    \ show follows a knitting show.\n- i took the dog for a walk.\n- does it pick\
    \ up any digital channels?\n- i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf,\
    \ but i offered her one of mine.\n- it seems that it may rain today.\n- oh, it\
    \ did. there were about 300 people there to honor us.\n- if we are good, we will\
    \ be happy in heaven with god.\n- no, because it hurts my ears.\n- i hate looking\
    \ for an apartment.\n- oh great, we could both work at burger king.\n- but people\
    \ still write poems.\n- check out the silverware.\n- my grandma's apartment smells\
    \ funny.\n- it sure isn't.\n- it was seven feet tall.\n- the digital signal is\
    \ very clear.\n- people say that everybody loves obama.\n- no, i couldn't make\
    \ it.\n- well, it's one of them.\n- oh, no. we can walk right in.\n- it's the\
    \ law.\n- i can't afford it.\n- i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.\n\
    - i have a stomachache.\n- it's not even 10 o'clock.\n- i'm terrible at math.\n\
    - about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.\n- is it new?\n- he might relax,\
    \ but it makes me nervous.\n- that's not the attitude of a good driver.\n- that's\
    \ the way cats are.\n- that's about $30,000.\n- so did i.\n- we'll stop at the\
    \ next mcdonald's.\n- well, i know how to flip hamburgers.\n- that's hard to take.\n\
    - so many people are out of work.\n- because of all the earthquakes and fires.\n\
    - i usually eat a simple salad.\n- that's the reason it was such a great game.\n\
    - i believe so.\n- some private organization.\n- me, too. i couldn't wait to graduate.\n\
    - it didn't smell bad.\n- i had a stomachache.\n- because i'll never find one\
    \ for such a low price.\n- no, thanks, maybe another time.\n- because of all the\
    \ security?\n- and eat too much.\n- i feel safe here.\n- okay, until next time\
    \ then.\n- i hate medication. it makes me feel different.\n- that was a long time\
    \ ago.\n- it has great weather all year long.\n- i vacuumed the entire house.\n\
    - look at these marks on my arms.\n- because food and other stuff sticks in my\
    \ beard.\n- bears are invading our neighborhoods.\n- oh, that's so delicious.\n\
    - but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.\n- he sank a 20-foot putt\
    \ on the last hole to win by one stroke!\n- no, that's not the problem.\n- my\
    \ car is dirty.\n- i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary.\n- coffee and\
    \ a roll?\n- well, that's cool.\n- i have lots of friends.\n- i didn't realize\
    \ that.\n- and lots of books.\n- two guys got into an argument.\n- i drove around\
    \ for half an hour.\n- did it get any better?\n- the streets and sidewalks are\
    \ clean.\n- turn on the light.\n- well, more than 50 million people voted for\
    \ mccain.\n- only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.\n- is that a tv\
    \ show?\n- but it's real easy to slip on.\n- golf is so hard.\n- now a stamp is\
    \ 42 cents.\n- i'm gaining weight.\n- people are friendly.\n- i couldn't wait.\
    \ it was an emergency.\n- that's what many people believe.\n- i wonder if every\
    \ language has jokes.\n- the price of stamps goes up and up.\n- i'm getting married.\n\
    - my boss offered me a promotion, and i took it.\n- we'll go to a french restaurant.\n\
    - mostly talk radio.\n- is it easy to learn?\n- it should have a pretty woman\
    \ on it.\n- i haven't lately.\n- i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.\n\
    - nobody told me.\n- i was busy the whole day.\n- i wouldn't do that.\n- the car\
    \ isn't here.\n- cats have beautiful eyes.\n- he's a dirty old man.\n- those shopping\
    \ carts are dangerous.\n- but i have rabbit ears.\n- it was long, too.\n- that\
    \ is a joke.\n- the election is next week.\n- i just cut myself again.\n- no,\
    \ my sister and i will travel together.\n- that's pretty simple.\n- i mixed them\
