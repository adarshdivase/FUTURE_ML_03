    - it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.\n- i had a car problem, so\
    \ i went online.\n- my grandma's apartment smells funny.\n- but girls like guys\
    \ who are funny.\n- so what are you going to do?\n- there are lots of different\
    \ kinds, but they all have one thing in common.\n- i hate going to parties.\n\
    - are you sure? i never heard of such a thing.\n- they are bites.\n- it's not\
    \ too bitter for you?\n- that's true. it is a very funny movie.\n- maybe in your\

    \ up my files.\n- i got ripped off.\n- look at the bottom of my shoes\xC2\u2014\
    they're clean.\n- especially on these slick floors.\n- that would be weird.\n\
    - i'm in a hurry.\n- only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.\n\
    - check out the silverware.\n- he's the only candidate that i trust.\n- well,\
    \ superbad is super funny.\n- but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning,\
    \ she can smell it that evening!\n- you're very lucky.\n- of course you are. you\
    \ ate everything on the table.\n- i already looked there.\n- this is such a long\
    \ light.\n- i'm falling asleep on the phone.\n- i'm going to the bank.\n- it was\
    \ like being there?\n- we had a problem at school.\n- our cousin went into labor\
    \ and had her baby last week.\n- gravity is very important.\n- i was writing a\
    \ letter.\n- well, you can't blame a man for asking.\n- i would if i could find\
    \ someone who makes strong pockets.\n- i will talk to your father about that.\n\
    - well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.\n- it's not in my wallet.\n\

    \ a couple of times.\n- i was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game\

    \ it.\n- it was tomato soup.\n- i'm having a party this friday.\n- i like the\
    \ different instruments that they use.\n- she laughed! she didn't believe me.\n\
    - he thinks i have too much stress.\n- you're trying to tell me something.\n-\
    \ yeah, i loved that class.\n- it was hot and sunny every day.\n- oh, a laptop,\
    \ of course.\n- that was nice of you.\n- well, the democratic party says it was\
    \ an honest election.\n- i'm watching you.\n- my waist is bigger than it was.\n\
    - you can help me.\n- that sounds like fun. let's do it.\n- i bought three pounds\
    \ of potatoes for a dollar.\n- but we have the same old problems.\n- i buy it\
    \ at the dollar store.\n- she's probably about five feet.\n- let's leave.\n- because\
    \ of all the earthquakes and fires.\n- mom, i want a puppy.\n- any one. i need\
    \ to sharpen this pencil.\n- wear a jacket, too.\n- about what?\n- they probably\
    \ will.\n- let me step outside and see.\n- my car is dirty.\n- but we need to\
    \ turn left.\n- if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.\n- it\
    \ seems fine to me.\n- in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.\n\
    - the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.\n- they're behind the\
    \ outfield.\n- i'll make an appointment tomorrow.\n- good! i just thought i'd\
    \ let you know.\n- i thought you had an elephant in your house.\n- i hate to go\
    \ outside.\n- it's supposed to start at about eight.\n- i couldn't go to school\
    \ today, i was sick.\n- well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later\
    \ on today.\n- she asked you about your pineapples?\n- in fact, it's chilly in\
    \ the apartment, too.\n- is it his money?\n- and then you hit it again.\n- my\
    \ mother was hurt and angry.\n- i sure hope not.\n- can they take their belongings?\n\
    - oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.\n-\
    \ you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.\n- i bought some new shoes.\n\
    - then i have a job for you in my kitchen.\n- fine. what's going on with you?\n\
    - i guess you see lots of different dogs.\n- so it won't get sick. just like you\
    \ get shots.\n- a cooking show follows a sewing show.\n- i watered all the plants.\n\
    - of course. i have lots of best friends.\n- will you be able to make it?\n- it's\
    \ almost empty.\n- even though they're in black and white.\n- i'll use a damp\
    \ cloth.\n- one hundred!\n- that's dangerous.\n- we each get five cards.\n- you\
    \ know what i'm talking about.\n- they work great.\n- someone had to chop the\
    \ wood.\n- i'm not sure.\n- our team played hard and won.\n- that's rude.\n- it's\
    \ an upstairs unit.\n- i'm afraid not.\n- it was a great game.\n- but i have rabbit\
    \ ears.\n- this city is full of jerks.\n- a blind date doesn't mean that she is\
    \ blind!\n- wow! that is nice. let's stay for two nights.\n- they're all so cute.\n\
    - maybe he ran out of gas.\n- i got divorced two years ago.\n- the mayor won by\
    \ only 2,000 votes.\n- maybe he had a good reason.\n- his nails were black!\n\
    - i had to bring work home with me.\n- i haven't decided yet.\n- i was looking\
    \ at something else.\n- it shouldn't take him long to fix it.\n- thanks for coming\
    \ to see me today.\n- we never have to call the police about anything.\n- and\
    \ then he turned right around.\n- uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.\n\
    - i want you to clean the bathroom.\n- so are cigarettes.\n- it sure is windy\
    \ today.\n- artists see things differently.\n- i wish i could afford first class\
    \ seats.\n- no pets are allowed.\n- a ham sandwich.\n- a little cigarette controls\
    \ them.\n- let me look. no, it's not there.\n- he had dirty fingernails.\n- and\
    \ they will yell back at you.\n- i have a little poodle.\n- oh. that's not good.\n\
    - he's visiting other cities to get ideas.\n- well, you'll have hot fresh food\
    \ tomorrow night.\n- i haven't seen her yet.\n- once in a while is once too many.\n\
    - oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.\n- no, florida just has hurricanes every\
    \ year from june to october.\n- occasionally.\n- was he smoking?\n- we also get\
    \ leather.\n- it's probably around somewhere.\n- and the rooms are clean, too.\n\
    - tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.\n- i've been coming here for\
    \ years.\n- i've enjoyed conversing with you.\n- that election for u.s. senator\
    \ stunk.\n- that one. the one that's all black.\n- wow! that's terrible.\n- no,\
    \ when i call him on his cell phone.\n- can i try your coffee?\n- kids are crying\
    \ or climbing over you.\n- but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools,\
    \ and prisons.\n- all you've lost is some sweat.\n- it works only in canada.\n\
    - will it be good beach weather?\n- we'll be here forever.\n- they added phony\
    \ charges to our bill.\n- oh, look. here's another shirt just like it.\n- we get\
    \ hamburgers and steak.\n- girls like guys with money.\n- there's something wrong\
    \ with my right hand.\n- i would've thought that somebody would have told you.\n\
    - you hit a white ball.\n- well, that's cool.\n- of course i do. but not on our\
    \ flag!\n- do you like it?\n- we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.\n\
    - do they talk about us?\n- if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing.\n\
    - i was thinking about seeing a movie.\n- of course. it's all over the news.\n\
    - i hope you kept the receipt.\n- only if my candidate wins.\n- you need a car\
    \ with low mileage.\n- but the title of measure 1 is \"better schools at no cost.\"\
    \n- i am going to see a movie with a friend of mine. what about you?\n- it's so\
    \ much trouble.\n- so how have you been lately?\n- are you going to go and visit\
    \ her and the baby?\n- a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going\
    \ to be?\n- that sounds delicious.\n- my pen is out of ink.\n- let's go jogging.\n\
    - me too. i want to play for the yankees.\n- of course they are. they're starving\
    \ to death.\n- are you feeling any better?\n- oh, no. our ashes will be shaken\
    \ into the ocean.\n- that's what i do.\n- you should bring some wipes with you.\n\
    - i never miss the food and drink section.\n- you have to change their diapers.\n\
    - great. which one?\n- hopefully it will.\n- but in may it will be 44 cents.\n\
    - actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.\n- they go in one ear and out\
    \ the other.\n- that will make him so happy.\n- of course. it's not a hard job.\n\
    - it's not even 10 o'clock.\n- it got rained out.\n- see you soon.\n- tv news\
    \ is so stupid.\n- do you know which one he would like?\n- yesterday they told\
    \ us about a dog in a pipe.\n- so was i.\n- well, listen to it more quietly.\n\
    - would you like anything for your stomach?\n- you shouldn't make him wait.\n\
    - it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.\n- no, like a good amateur\
    \ golfer.\n- for example, a friend of mine licks his lips.\n- are there going\
    \ to be layoffs at this place?\n- they bark at everything.\n- with what?\n- me,\
    \ neither.\n- he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.\n- excuse me.\n\
    - a third guy punched one of the two guys.\n- will you go and visit them?\n- it\
    \ was long, too.\n- also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.\n\
    - that's a great price.\n- they brushed with their fingers.\n- beer is a powerful\
    \ drug.\n- there's no food in the woods.\n- voting is so easy. you can even mail\
    \ your ballot in.\n- i usually eat a simple salad.\n- do you believe in god?\n\
    - they both said i have to live with it.\n- i didn't do anything.\n- maybe i will\
    \ be the first!\n- is that right? i already got my invitation from her earlier.\n\
    - do you like it there?\n- i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.\n\
    - and it's not too small.\n- i know. i had to chase you for a while.\n- the dome\
    \ doesn't close.\n- i was laughing through the whole movie.\n- hmm, that's not\
    \ bad.\n- i didn't have a tissue.\n- do you need a calculator?\n- a mad dog bit\
    \ most of her face off.\n- i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.\n\
    - yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.\n- this is a\
    \ nice neighborhood.\n- the one that tiger won?\n- three bedrooms, three bathrooms,\
    \ and a big back yard.\n- i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary.\n- i\
    \ must not use this finger until the cut heals.\n- i made sure to be in line to\
    \ see it the first day it came out.\n- do you see all this gray hair? it was totally\
    \ black five years ago.\n- that's nice.\n- it is delicious, especially with butter.\n\
    - the walls were so thin.\n- he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.\n- without\
    \ gravity, you would go up.\n- that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at\
    \ this store.\n- that didn't take long.\n- he's a famous artist.\n- are you interested?\n\
    - that was a nice thing to say.\n- the weather this weekend is supposed to be\
    \ warm.\n- do you know why i pulled you over?\n- well, i guess if it ever does\
    \ get old, i'll change to something different.\n- you mean he could drown.\n-\
    \ same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.\n- that will teach\
    \ him a good lesson.\n- that sounds good.\n- they're in the kitchen drawer.\n\
    - and i want to get a big cabin with a view.\n- but he dives to relax.\n- look\
    \ how many cars are waiting in line.\n- i didn't even have lunch.\n- boy, that\
    \ is a good nose.\n- coffee and a roll?\n- i'm sure i'll like it, too.\n- well\
    \ anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?\n- i know, you're absolutely\
    \ right.\n- because you helped make it dirty.\n- i saw a painting of a jar that\
    \ was full of pencils.\n- i bought lots of oranges and apples.\n- it gets worse\
    \ every year.\n- tell me when you finish.\n- it leaves at 12:15.\n- i'm throwing\
    \ a party on friday.\n- and a puppy eats food. food costs money.\n- so the cop\
    \ will stop those cars?\n- that's horrible. i'd be happy to give you the assignments\
    \ from english class.\n- well whatever, i'm glad you came.\n- i called hp about\
    \ my computer.\n- i first learned how to do it in high school.\n- you got up real\
    \ early.\n- you have pretty eyes.\n- his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong\
    \ and healthy.\n- i mean, it's just coffee.\n- you still miss him.\n- but you're\
    \ doing 75.\n- here you go.\n- i hope we'll catch a foul ball.\n- and you're mine\
    \ forever.\n- that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.\n- last month they\
    \ told us about a mouse in a restaurant.\n- that's no good.\n- this sunday?\n\
    - i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.\n- he landed on the hood of\
    \ the car.\n- i like this hotel.\n- you haven't told me anything yet.\n- yeah,\
    \ especially since it's ninety degrees outside.\n- if you want to lose fat, you've\
    \ got to do this hike every day.\n- i thought you had a job.\n- eat the fruit.\
    \ it's good for you.\n- i had to take my friend to the airport.\n- it was new\
    \ in 2003.\n- do you have any other skills?\n- the party starts at 8.\n- that\
    \ was mean to say.\n- look! he just hit that car.\n- can i borrow $5?\n- he's\
    \ the best man for president.\n- it's not orange!\n- maybe you should, just in\
    \ case it gets colder.\n- can you make it?\n- i want to be a mail carrier when\
    \ i grow up.\n- i filled up my freezer with ice cream.\n- in case we have visitors.\n\
    - and when elected, they go their own way.\n- i like a good story.\n- she got\
    \ an \"everything\" job!\n- so what's the problem?\n- but it won't stop other\
    \ players from using drugs.\n- i hate homework.\n- they sure do.\n- i'm not quite\
    \ sure yet.\n- i enjoy rock and r&b.\n- i'm sorry. i'm already doing something\
    \ this friday.\n- i hope that i'll see you there.\n- but most of those hurricanes\
    \ are harmless.\n- if only i was talented.\n- no. it's in southern california.\n\
    - i'd better see you there.\n- so, they do a good job for the money.\n- but cigarettes\
    \ taste much better when you have a cold beer.\n- i'm going to give them away.\
    \ do you want one?\n- i'll go up front and talk to the manager.\n- not to mention\
    \ 40,000 wounded soldiers.\n- i have to walk the dog.\n- he might want to cut\

    \ what have you been up to?\n- the title should be \"better schools at huge cost.\"\
    \n- the government says we have nothing to worry about.\n- i'll call you so we\
    \ can set that up.\n- i'm so happy for you.\n- i know, it would be horrible if\
    \ it rained and it was hot outside.\n- well, you'd better take it out front.\n\
