    \ or five pounds?\n- i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.\n- it looks\
    \ like blood.\n- let me help you.\n- we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.\n\
    - well, they do put their party before their country.\n- i hope they are fast\
    \ minutes.\n- all the tv stations are going to go digital.\n- the victim hit his\

    \ parade.\n- but what can you do?\n- are you telling me that you've seen her before?\n\

    \ doesn't do any good.\n- i'm going to the bank.\n- but i have rabbit ears.\n\
    - that means it will get hotter.\n- i have no idea how much it will cost.\n- there\
    \ is no crime here.\n- and he yelled back at me.\n- so why are we selling our\
    \ house?\n- it should be warmer in a few minutes.\n- it's got a big yard.\n- i\

    \ so, what's the problem?\n- oh, thank you. that's very nice of you.\n- i have\
    \ no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren.\n- let's go to the beach.\n- artists\

    \ a good lesson.\n- i took the dog for a walk.\n- if they are all outside, then\
    \ what?\n- good luck with school.\n- thanks.\n- it leaves at 12:15.\n- so she\
    \ likes poodles.\n- sure. here you go.\n- no. i already have a pen.\n- do they\
    \ help you run faster?\n- me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.\n\
    - i liked it.\n- i'm glad sunday is only once a week.\n- you should take a break.\n\
    - and there are only six units in the whole building.\n- nothing that would pass\
    \ as news.\n- i'll rinse the car first.\n- to thank him and all the other soldiers\
    \ who served in world war ii.\n- even though they're in black and white.\n- i\
    \ found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.\n- nope, and it drives\
    \ him crazy.\n- no more homework.\n- i will play the radio as loud as i want.\n\
    - they didn't say.\n- it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.\n- well\
    \ regardless, i'm very happy that you came to see me.\n- it is delicious, especially\
    \ with butter.\n- i always try to be polite.\n- no. that's incomplete.\n- that\
    \ would be great, then we could plan things sooner.\n- sorry about that. i was\
    \ cleaning up.\n- i'm not sure yet.\n- maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting\
    \ so long.\n- he might want to cut you open.\n- \"\xC2\u2026and you know you should\
    \ be glad!\"\n- that's a good price.\n- the league suspended him for 50 games.\n\
    - the one that stole a small plane?\n- this friday, i'm throwing a party.\n- well,\
    \ that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.\n- to the city, of course.\n- the tv news\
    \ doesn't tell us the race anymore.\n- then why aren't i having fun?\n- you're\
    \ right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.\n- so, i'll\
    \ just buy another one.\n- i was laughing through the whole movie.\n- well, i\
    \ guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different.\n- my husband\
    \ died.\n- only if my candidate wins.\n- before you go to that interview, check\
    \ yourself.\n- any rain right now would be pointless.\n- there's a new girl in\
    \ school, have you seen her yet?\n- i'm sorry, i can't.\n- can't he just go online?\n\
    - i hope god didn't hear that.\n- i feel safe here.\n- i have no insurance.\n\
    - i like the different instruments that they use.\n- four hours, without a break.\n\
    - well, you'd better take it out front.\n- spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach\
    \ you.\n- i'll do that in a minute.\n- i thought about getting out and taking\
    \ a taxi home.\n- oh. of course i'm ready.\n- so, they do a good job for the money.\n\
    - i know. i went to china yesterday.\n- gravity is very important.\n- look at\
    \ the bottom of my shoes\xC2\u2014they're clean.\n- you're right. this one does\
    \ have an extra button.\n- please?\n- well, i can always pull over.\n- i'll bet\
    \ he was drinking, too.\n- your wallet is empty?\n- but it's uncomfortable.\n\
    - they're all the same.\n- and i have to take care of our children.\n- they call\
    \ him father dollar bill.\n- our room was right next to the elevator and the ice\
    \ machine.\n- i can't believe he won the election.\n- that's a good reason to\
    \ like something.\n- bring a jacket.\n- that was an odd change of subject.\n-\
    \ can't you take medicine or something for it?\n- i was thinking of driving to\
    \ arizona.\n- that was mean to say.\n- no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty,\
    \ because i'm pretty hungry right now.\n- but the house is so nice.\n- then wait\
    \ till you find a tissue.\n- thank you. i just got these shoes today.\n- and then\
    \ we can go to my home.\n- i had no idea.\n- stress causes your stomachaches?\n\
    - coffee and a roll?\n- i hate homework.\n- i know that we need milk.\n- have\
    \ you gone to school today?\n- i just insert my debit card into the machine.\n\
    - mostly talk radio.\n- i want it to cool down some.\n- i didn't hear anything\
    \ about it.\n- that's true. it is a very funny movie.\n- i'm having a party next\
    \ saturday.\n- all the radios will be on extra loud.\n- i'll talk to you later.\n\
    - and then he turned right around.\n- they will drop the new steak on the floor,\
    \ step on it, and then spit on it.\n- no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.\n\
    - and the government will give you a fourth story.\n- i am dying from the heat.\n\
    - that's pretty old.\n- but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.\n\
    - sounds like it was a close game.\n- she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.\n\
    - he's a famous artist.\n- that's what made it so great.\n- i like how clear the\
    \ sky gets after it rains.\n- that's disgusting.\n- florida doesn't have earthquakes\
    \ or fires.\n- can we go to the baseball game?\n- but they can just knock on the\
    \ door.\n- i got divorced two years ago.\n- then we can scrub it with a wet sponge\
    \ and soap.\n- i have a date tomorrow night.\n- i'll keep my receipt and my gun.\n\
    - that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you.\n- everyone wants you to\
    \ solve their problems.\n- they added phony charges to our bill.\n- look at all\
    \ these kittens!\n- still, it's safer than florida.\n- it should have a pretty\
    \ woman on it.\n- hey, what's up?\n- there's nothing in it.\n- i agree. pasadena\
    \ is a nice city.\n- yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation.\n- i watched\
    \ it once. that was enough.\n- a dentist, i'm sure.\n- it's perfect for us and\
    \ the kids.\n- maybe you should use an electric shaver.\n- even if it's only for\
    \ a short while.\n- high school or middle school?\n- i'm just yawning because\
    \ the commercials are on.\n- female singers are supposed to be pretty.\n- i have\
    \ no idea. i've been here for 20 years.\n- forget it. go straight.\n- bring a\
    \ glove to catch a foul ball.\n- i hate going to parties.\n- that's what i'm going\
    \ to do.\n- oh, that's so delicious.\n- but it won't stop other players from using\
    \ drugs.\n- you'd better buy your ticket now.\n- against all of them, of course.\n\
    - the worst in the whole world.\n- i can't read my book.\n- no, the white walk\
    \ sign was blinking.\n- also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good\
    \ coffee.\n- with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.\n- i started teaching\
    \ five years ago.\n- do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?\n- i know what\
    \ you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot.\n- so why can't i have pizza for\
    \ dinner?\n- i sure would like to see something interesting for a change.\n- i\
    \ wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.\n- because you're thinking too\
    \ much.\n- well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.\n- i had\
    \ a stomachache.\n- is that it?\n- you and everybody else.\n- he said he would\
    \ buy her a nice ring.\n- worried about what?\n- i parked it right here.\n- a\
    \ tutor helped me get the d!\n- i voted for obama.\n- but cigarettes taste much\
    \ better when you have a cold beer.\n- i'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.\n\
    - no, thanks. i already took some medicine.\n- we're stuck with him for four more\
    \ years.\n- a ham sandwich.\n- i will poke your eyes out.\n- it will cost you\
    \ only $20 plus parts.\n- out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your\
    \ favorite?\n- i can't believe he hasn't crashed.\n- they probably wouldn't like\
    \ that.\n- well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?\n- i couldn't\
    \ help laughing, either.\n- your day was just like mine.\n- oh, a laptop, of course.\n\
    - have you decided how you are going to vote?\n- i want to go to the ball game.\n\
    - i used to work in a deli.\n- i'm so happy for you.\n- good for him.\n- the cops\
    \ finally found the husband.\n- winter is great. i wish it didn't get so cold\
    \ sometimes though.\n- sometimes i want to throw it out the window.\n- you shouldn't\
    \ make him wait.\n- then why were you looking at her?\n- ha! we're not funny-looking;\
    \ animals are funny-looking.\n- the digital signal is very clear.\n- i like this\
    \ magazine.\n- i got a d in college chemistry.\n- that's how i feel, i want winter\
    \ to come soon.\n- do you listen to the radio?\n- you're trying to tell me something.\n\
    - yeah, so are you planning on going?\n- it didn't smell bad.\n- i can't wait\
    \ until i graduate.\n- there are other things i need to take care of.\n- i haven't\
    \ looked anywhere yet.\n- a good battery would have saved his life.\n- i usually\
    \ eat a simple salad.\n- i like to hit the ball.\n- well, i have to go back upstairs\
    \ anyway.\n- are you crazy?\n- ready for the big switch.\n- they want to get guns\
    \ off the street.\n- no, it's too close to the front door.\n- but a nice restaurant\
    \ costs money.\n- the election is next week.\n- i'm not being nosey, it's just\
    \ a question.\n- there's something wrong with my right hand.\n- one or two tires\
    \ were cut on each car.\n- a band-aid might not work.\n- he had dirty fingernails.\n\
    - well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.\n- i live in\
    \ pasadena.\n- tell me about this patch.\n- i believe so.\n- lately, i've been\
    \ quite busy.\n- oh great, we could both work at burger king.\n- debrah had her\
    \ baby last week.\n- to the state or the city?\n- i can't believe we haven't seen\
    \ any animals.\n- the man fell asleep.\n- oh, that's easy.\n- will you look at\
    \ this form?\n- do you need a calculator?\n- that wasn't very nice of her.\n-\
    \ you have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend?\n- eleven cars.\n\
    - the island is so green, and the water is so blue.\n- our team played hard and\
    \ won.\n- obama's got four years to make everyone happy.\n- mine too.\n- the mayor\
    \ says the crime rate is going down.\n- check out the silverware.\n- these are\
    \ chucks.\n- and it was only 12 years.\n- i would if i had the money.\n- maybe\
    \ i left the burner on.\n- do your students ever talk about their jobs?\n- some\
    \ actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.\n- it goes on and on\
    \ forever.\n- no, i was in the crosswalk.\n- last night they told us about a cat\
    \ in a sofa.\n- that's not what i meant by \"do something.\"\n- an andy warhol\
    \ drawing.\n- let's go out to eat.\n- that's nice, have you been to the movies\
    \ lately?\n- i can smell you, too.\n- let's stop for a while. i need a break and\
    \ some water.\n- yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.\n- our team\
    \ won 101-98.\n- so does every smoker.\n- i want to be a baseball player when\

    \ was owned by a little old lady.\n- thank you. i just bought these new shoes\
    \ earlier today.\n- working.\n- that's not nice.\n- buy a new one.\n- it was only\
    \ about $120 for a 13-inch screen.\n- i see that you're pretty talented.\n- they're\
    \ all so cute.\n- she was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.\n- i was looking at something\
    \ else.\n- beer is a powerful drug.\n- so are mine.\n- i didn't have to. it's\
    \ been in business for 60 years.\n- i will blow my nose sometime for you, and\
    \ you'll see.\n- no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little.\n- tell me what\
    \ you've been up to.\n- does your girlfriend ever make you angry?\n- you're right.\n\
    - he should act his age.\n- you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.\n- maybe\
    \ the milk was bad.\n- my bad, i had chores to do.\n- well whatever, i'm glad\
    \ you came.\n- well, she's quite short.\n- oh, look. i have four tens.\n- i like\
    \ the ones i can sing along with.\n- it's in a great neighborhood.\n- i understand.\

    \ yeah, yeah!...\"\n- thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.\n- there's\
    \ no food in the woods.\n- then i have a job for you in my kitchen.\n- i always\
    \ read the film reviews.\n- well, that should get you something.\n- a movie sounds\
    \ good.\n- i tell my students to become a teacher.\n- i didn't know that.\n- that\
    \ doesn't make it right.\n- well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.\n- i'll\

    \ it before we order dinner?\n- because of all the earthquakes and fires.\n- i\
    \ mean i have wonderful students.\n- these are some chucks.\n- that's dangerous.\n\
    - do you know why i pulled you over?\n- i was told about it already. i'm just\
    \ waiting for my invitation.\n- it's in california.\n- are you going to be there?\n\
    - it has great schools.\n- so how have you been lately?\n- everyone likes bacon\

    \ are dirty, too.\n- the artist said the jar was both full and empty.\n- so, a\
    \ little salt and pepper never hurt anything.\n- it's based on a true story about\
    \ a divorced man and his young son.\n- it's better to be pale than to have skin\
    \ cancer.\n- i've been to two doctors.\n- he's old enough to be my father, yet\
    \ he asked me out.\n- of course they are. they're starving to death.\n- i bought\
    \ it on a hunch.\n- that's my perfume.\n- they're in the kitchen drawer.\n- in\
    \ case we have visitors.\n- he will be a great president.\n- you'd be blind for\

    - the streets and sidewalks are clean.\n- someone cut the tires.\n- and a one-pound\
    \ tub of soft butter was the same price.\n- same here.\n- no, but that was a random\
    \ change of subject.\n- i sure hope not.\n- that was a huge fire in santa barbara.\n\
    - you need a car with low mileage.\n- i feel sorry for you.\n- it was tomato soup.\n\
    - your daddy was a good little boy.\n- it's close to the beach.\n- that's correct.\n\

    \ at the supermarket?\n- i would like to.\n- that's about $30,000.\n- i've called\
    \ you a hundred times today.\n- they probably will.\n- a family with only one\
    \ baby.\n- then we'll just make a u-turn.\n- last week they told us about a bear\

    \ for my son.\n- do you smell that?\n- you had pizza for lunch.\n- the price of\
    \ stamps goes up and up.\n- while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food.\n\
    - that's it?\n- i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.\n- because it\
    \ will protect you in case of an accident.\n- exactly what?\n- it got rained out.\n\
    - let's turn on the heat.\n- my wife left me.\n- it's on the tip of my finger.\n\
    - i need to withdraw some money.\n- all it takes is will power, and you have it.\n\
    - i sure do.\n- i certainly hope not!\n- i guess they haven't read this article.\n\
    - is this a clean restaurant?\n- i was doing my homework.\n- i've also been busy.\n\
    - no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.\n- are you having problems\
    \ with it?\n- we each get five cards.\n- so it's better to save money than to\
    \ have an honest election?\n- natural food has more vitamins.\n- it has beautiful\
    \ houses.\n- here he comes now.\n- it's more than just a date.\n- it seems that\
    \ it may rain today.\n- i thought they were playing under a dome.\n- i hope you\

    - i bought you a pair of pants.\n- the wind blows those trucks over.\n- but you\
    \ won't date him again?\n- so what? they still drove off.\n- he stayed on the\
    \ thirteenth floor.\n- actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.\n- my\
    \ dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument.\n- i see that former\
    \ president bush is at a conference.\n- i'm a babysitter.\n- also, there aren't\
    \ enough police.\n- berries aren't in season all year round.\n- i buried him with\
    \ his cell phone.\n- but it went by fast. it was interesting.\n- i wouldn't do\
    \ that.\n- exactly, it seems like it's going to be loads of fun.\n- it sure is\
    \ windy today.\n- without the peanut butter!\n- i like my food hot and fresh.\n\
    - i'm not quite sure yet.\n- sure.\n- i have to do some things, and besides, it's\

    \ restaurants.\n- well, i know how to flip hamburgers.\n- so, forget it.\n- i\
    \ had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them.\n- i was\
    \ scratching my nose.\n- sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.\n- then\
    \ why can't i quit?\n- someone punched out someone.\n- i have to be there two\
    \ hours early.\n- they still make movies like that.\n- anything else?\n- never\
    \ park your car under a tree.\n- he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.\n\
    - we have to practice every day.\n- they say he's going 80 miles per hour.\n-\
    \ it went by pretty fast.\n- then why are you watching tv?\n- number two, it's\
    \ usually late.\n- i'm not being nosey. i'm just asking.\n- open the book.\n-\
    \ life is hard.\n- singers are supposed to sound good.\n- so go then.\n- you're\
    \ kidding. you might get killed.\n- i saw it eight times.\n- the tape recorder\
    \ is broken.\n- i never miss the food and drink section.\n- i went to the beach\
    \ every day.\n- $1,000.\n- that sounds wonderful.\n- i loved it. i want to live\
    \ there.\n- i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.\n- and\
    \ they're clean.\n- just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.\n\
    - if only i was talented.\n- he's going to kill someone.\n- i was there when i\

    \ rock and r&b.\n- then go find a tissue in the bathroom.\n- i'm having fun.\n\
    - maybe i should see a doctor.\n- that is true. the weather is constantly changing.\n\
    - except we can't afford it!\n- no, like a good amateur golfer.\n- and it's just\
    \ as easy to prepare.\n- that sounds like a great job.\n- english.\n- i drove\
    \ around for half an hour.\n- he said he wasn't using drugs.\n- ha! you can't\
    \ win if you do play.\n- all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.\n-\
    \ i called hp about my computer.\n- no one at work likes him.\n- three bedrooms,\
    \ three bathrooms, and a big back yard.\n- lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.\n\
    - but no one knows for sure.\n- no one makes any money at it.\n- and watch your\
    \ dvd.\n- tell me when you finish.\n- but the title of measure 1 is \"better schools\
    \ at no cost.\"\n- i want to be a mail carrier when i grow up.\n- thank you. i\
    \ just got this outfit the other day.\n- you can help me.\n- i would if i could\

    \ you know what movie you're going to watch?\n- then it will look like new\n-\
    \ she laughed! she didn't believe me.\n- maybe we can go see a movie or something.\n\
    - he might tell me to rest for a while.\n- no one speaks perfect english.\n- do\
    \ it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials.\n- i'm serious,\
    \ have you?\n- is it easy to learn?\n- they talk about food and the weather.\n\
    - you're right. you have to stand in the aisle.\n- have you ever lost a letter\
    \ in the mail?\n- you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.\n- it's a\
    \ paper cut.\n- no good movies come to mind.\n- oh, yeah.\n- i won't be able to\
    \ play with the kids.\n- only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.\n\
    - it's such a chore.\n- were you able to attend friday night's basketball game?\n\
    - it might as well be me.\n- then he didn't bother to apologize.\n- it smells\
    \ so bad.\n- i'll call you later.\n- you do this 18 times, because there are 18\
    \ holes.\n- look! he just got out of the car and started running.\n- i have only\
    \ a few friends.\n- put your seatbelt on.\n- friends will lend you money when\
    \ you're broke.\n- finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.\n- i'm\

    \ channel.\n- that's not good.\n- oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.\n\
    - so has everyone else.\n- that's hard to take.\n- that would be nice, thank you.\n\
    - teaching is a great job.\n- not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.\n- doctors\
    \ are too expensive.\n- tell me what you've been doing.\n- he's never going to\
    \ make everyone happy.\n- yeah, it sounds like it's going to be the best party\
    \ of the year.\n- i'm sorry to hear that. would you like the assignments from\
    \ english class?\n- i type too much.\n- have you heard something that you're not\
    \ telling me?\n- i'm having a party this friday.\n- we'll be here forever.\n-\

    \ thinking.\n- is there somewhere special you wanted to go?\n- only 15 percent\
    \ of the voters turned out.\n- i just peeled it, and i'm looking at it right now.\n\
    - if not, your nose will wake you up.\n- we haven't been in a month.\n- they forget\
    \ where they came from.\n- i've been trying to call you all day.\n- our tv remote\
    \ is filthy.\n- you're funny.\n- your white shirt is ruined.\n- i'm absolutely\
    \ lovely, thank you.\n- my favorite movie is superbad.\n- turn the radio down,\

    - anyway, i have to fix the hole.\n- but work goes on forever!\n- i enjoy the\
    \ different types of instruments that they use.\n- me, too. i couldn't wait to\

    \ you knew.\n- well, it's good and bad.\n- i want to move to new york.\n- i bought\
    \ three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.\n- ready for what?\n- well, it's your\
    \ life.\n- that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.\n- but we need new taxes\

    - it was nice talking to you.\n- eight.\n- last year we made a big snowman.\n\
    - maybe i know, but how could you know?\n- i wish i was free that night. i'm kind\
    \ of mad that i didn't go.\n- do you need a pen?\n- are you going to wash it yourself?\n\

    \ in the sun for too long.\n- i got laid off because there was no work.\n- they're\
    \ in a different world.\n- i was unable to make it.\n- that must be nice.\n- in\
    \ fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.\n- three pounds just this month.\n\
    - if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god.\n- he drew two butterflies\
    \ and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.\n- i'm not sleeping on that sheet.\n\
    - of course.\n- i need some pants.\n- here comes the waiter. see if his hands\
    \ and nails are clean.\n- i'm trying to stretch my dollars.\n- his doctor says\
    \ his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.\n- this is a great neighborhood.\n\
    - no human could possibly play golf that well.\n- have you looked in the mirror?\n\
    - but what if i'm a fish in my next life?\n- i'm afraid not.\n- it was the best\
    \ game ever.\n- my grandma's apartment smells funny.\n- i will.\n- i wanted to\
    \ go, but i couldn't.\n- i didn't say that.\n- that's because they cook it while\
    \ you wait.\n- someone had to chop the wood.\n- so do i.\n- i enjoy drawing and\
    \ painting.\n- number five, it's unsafe.\n- you started eating ice cream?\n- then\
    \ he drove too fast to the restaurant.\n- i just wanted to give you the good news.\n\
    - maybe it's the wrong tree.\n- look in the fridge.\n- they say he has started\
    \ fifteen big fires.\n- are you going to be buried next to each other?\n- just\
    \ yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.\n\

    \ it a nice day?\n- he probably won't use drugs anymore.\n- that tasted so good.\n\
    - especially for drivers of big trucks.\n- let me get the keys.\n- you should\
    \ bring some wipes with you.\n- would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?\n\
    - prove it.\n- that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food.\n- i\
    \ can't do that.\n- let's play cards.\n- my father found a new girlfriend.\n-\
    \ that isn't a good deal?\n- me neither.\n- yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.\n\
    - you know what that means.\n- so does mine.\n- no, because i'm eating food that\

    \ the best.\n- he sounds like a real jerk.\n- of course they match.\n- you're\
    \ joking.\n- i'm thinking, but i still have to go.\n- the weather in california\
    \ is unpredictable, so you never know.\n- are you ready?\n- you should go to bed.\n\
    - it can be dangerous.\n- i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.\n\
