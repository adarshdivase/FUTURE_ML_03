  - text: i like it so far. my classes are pretty good right now.
  utter_qa_pair_32:
  - text: it's an ugly day today.
  utter_qa_pair_33:
  - text: i know. i think it may rain.
  utter_qa_pair_34:
  - text: it's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
  utter_qa_pair_35:
  - text: that would be weird.
  utter_qa_pair_36:
  - text: yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
  utter_qa_pair_37:
  - text: i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
  utter_qa_pair_38:
  - text: yes, it would be.
  utter_qa_pair_39:
  - text: i really wish it wasn't so hot every day.
  utter_qa_pair_40:
  - text: me too. i can't wait until winter.
  utter_qa_pair_41:
  - text: i like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
  utter_qa_pair_42:
  - text: i'd rather be cold than hot.
  utter_qa_pair_43:
  - text: it doesn't look very nice outside today.
  utter_qa_pair_44:
  - text: you're right. i think it's going to rain later.
  utter_qa_pair_45:
  - text: in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
  utter_qa_pair_46:
  - text: that wouldn't seem right.
  utter_qa_pair_47:
  - text: considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
  utter_qa_pair_48:
  - text: exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot.
  utter_qa_pair_49:
  - text: i know, you're absolutely right.
  utter_qa_pair_50:
  - text: i wish it would cool off one day.
  utter_qa_pair_51:
  - text: that's how i feel, i want winter to come soon.
  utter_qa_pair_52:
  - text: i enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
  utter_qa_pair_53:
  - text: i know what you mean, but i'd rather be cold than hot.
  utter_qa_pair_54:
  - text: i wish it was a nicer day today.
  utter_qa_pair_55:
  - text: that is true. i hope it doesn't rain.
  utter_qa_pair_56:
  - text: it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
  utter_qa_pair_57:
  - text: it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
  utter_qa_pair_58:
  - text: it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
  utter_qa_pair_59:
  - text: any rain right now would be pointless.
  utter_qa_pair_60:
  - text: that's right, it really would be.
  utter_qa_pair_61:
  - text: i want it to cool down some.
  utter_qa_pair_62:
  - text: i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter.
  utter_qa_pair_63:

  - text: yes, it is.
  utter_qa_pair_66:
  - text: it looks like it may rain soon.
  utter_qa_pair_67:
  - text: yes, and i hope that it does.
  utter_qa_pair_68:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_69:
  - text: i really love how rain clears the air.
  utter_qa_pair_70:
  - text: me too. it always smells so fresh after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_71:
  - text: yes, but i love the night air after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_72:
  - text: really? why is it?
  utter_qa_pair_73:
  - text: because you can see the stars perfectly.
  utter_qa_pair_74:
  - text: i really hope it rains today.
  utter_qa_pair_75:

  utter_qa_pair_76:

  utter_qa_pair_80:
  - text: i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_81:
  - text: i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_82:
  - text: i especially love the night air when it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_83:
  - text: really? why?
  utter_qa_pair_84:
  - text: the stars look so much closer after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_85:
  - text: i really want it to rain today.
  utter_qa_pair_86:
  - text: don't you think it's nice out?
  utter_qa_pair_87:
  - text: yes, i think so too.
  utter_qa_pair_88:
  - text: i think that it's going to rain.
  utter_qa_pair_89:
  - text: i hope that it does rain.
  utter_qa_pair_90:
  - text: you like the rain?
  utter_qa_pair_91:
  - text: the sky looks so clean after it rains. i love it.
  utter_qa_pair_92:
  - text: i understand. rain does make it smell cleaner.
  utter_qa_pair_93:
  - text: i love most how it is at night after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_94:
  - text: how come?
  utter_qa_pair_95:
  - text: you can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
  utter_qa_pair_96:
  - text: i really want to go to the beach this weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_97:
  - text: that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?
  utter_qa_pair_98:
  - text: i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_99:
  - text: is it going to be perfect beach weather?
  utter_qa_pair_100:
  - text: i believe so.
  utter_qa_pair_101:
  - text: good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_102:
  - text: i know. i really want to go to the beach.
  utter_qa_pair_103:
  - text: but you know that california weather is really unpredictable.
  utter_qa_pair_104:
  - text: you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
  utter_qa_pair_105:
  - text: i really wish the weather would just stay the same.
  utter_qa_pair_106:
  - text: i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
  utter_qa_pair_107:
  - text: i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_108:
  - text: a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be?
  utter_qa_pair_109:
  - text: the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_110:
  - text: so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?
  utter_qa_pair_111:
  - text: it sounds like it will be.
  utter_qa_pair_112:
  - text: i really hope it doesn't get cold.
  utter_qa_pair_113:
  - text: that would ruin things, i want to go so badly.
  utter_qa_pair_114:
  - text: the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know.
  utter_qa_pair_115:
  - text: that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
  utter_qa_pair_116:
  - text: it would be nice if the weather would never change.
  utter_qa_pair_117:
  - text: that would be great, then we could plan things sooner.
  utter_qa_pair_118:
  - text: it would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_119:
  - text: what's the weather going to be like? i may want to go too.
  utter_qa_pair_120:
  - text: the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.
  utter_qa_pair_121:
  - text: will it be good beach weather?
  utter_qa_pair_122:
  - text: i think it will be.
  utter_qa_pair_123:
  - text: it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
  utter_qa_pair_124:
  - text: i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm.
  utter_qa_pair_125:
  - text: this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll
      happen.
  utter_qa_pair_126:
  - text: i know. every day the weather seems different.
  utter_qa_pair_127:
  - text: i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
  utter_qa_pair_128:
  - text: hello, may i speak to alice please?
  utter_qa_pair_129:
  - text: this is she. how's it going?
  utter_qa_pair_130:
  - text: i've been trying to call you all day.

  utter_qa_pair_133:
  - text: so what were you calling me about?
  utter_qa_pair_134:

  utter_qa_pair_151:
  - text: you're talking to her.
  utter_qa_pair_152:
  - text: i've called you a hundred times today.
  utter_qa_pair_153:
  - text: i was busy doing something. i apologize.
  utter_qa_pair_154:
  - text: no problem.
  utter_qa_pair_155:
  - text: did you need something?
  utter_qa_pair_156:
  - text: do you want to do something tomorrow?
  utter_qa_pair_157:
  - text: is there somewhere special you wanted to go?
  utter_qa_pair_158:
  - text: how about a movie?
  utter_qa_pair_159:
  - text: a movie sounds good.
  utter_qa_pair_160:
  - text: have you seen the new girl in school?
  utter_qa_pair_161:
  - text: no, i haven't.
  utter_qa_pair_162:
  - text: she's really pretty.
  utter_qa_pair_163:
  - text: describe her to me.
  utter_qa_pair_164:
  - text: she's not too tall.
  utter_qa_pair_165:
  - text: well, how tall is she?
  utter_qa_pair_166:
  - text: she's about five feet even.
  utter_qa_pair_167:
  - text: what does she look like, though?
  utter_qa_pair_168:
  - text: she has pretty light brown eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_169:
  - text: i may know which girl you're talking about.
  utter_qa_pair_170:
  - text: so you have seen her around?
  utter_qa_pair_171:
  - text: there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?
  utter_qa_pair_172:
  - text: i haven't seen her yet.
  utter_qa_pair_173:
  - text: i think that she is very pretty.
  utter_qa_pair_174:
  - text: tell me how she looks.
  utter_qa_pair_175:
  - text: she's kind of short.
  utter_qa_pair_176:
  - text: what height is she?
  utter_qa_pair_177:
  - text: she's probably about five feet.
  utter_qa_pair_178:
  - text: that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.
  utter_qa_pair_179:
  - text: the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_180:
  - text: i think i might've bumped into her before.
  utter_qa_pair_181:
  - text: are you telling me that you've seen her before?
  utter_qa_pair_182:

  utter_qa_pair_184:
  - text: she's one of the prettiest girls at the school.
  utter_qa_pair_185:
  - text: what does she look like?
  utter_qa_pair_186:
  - text: well, she's quite short.
  utter_qa_pair_187:
  - text: how tall would you say that she is?
  utter_qa_pair_188:
  - text: i would say she's only five feet.
  utter_qa_pair_189:
  - text: what about her facial features?
  utter_qa_pair_190:
  - text: she has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful.
  utter_qa_pair_191:
  - text: i think i know who you're talking about.
  utter_qa_pair_192:

  utter_qa_pair_193:

  utter_qa_pair_194:
  - text: what was wrong with you?
  utter_qa_pair_195:
  - text: my stomach was upset.
  utter_qa_pair_196:
  - text: do you feel better now?

  utter_qa_pair_200:

  - text: i'll make sure and come to your next party.
  utter_qa_pair_666:
  - text: it was nice talking to you.
  utter_qa_pair_667:
  - text: why are you trying to rush me off the phone?
  utter_qa_pair_668:

  utter_qa_pair_682:
  - text: i'm not being nosey. i'm just asking.
  utter_qa_pair_683:
  - text: i really don't think it's any of your business.
  utter_qa_pair_684:
  - text: that's not nice.

  utter_qa_pair_789:

  - text: i think he wanted to cool off.
  utter_qa_pair_791:
  - text: he swam right up to you.
  utter_qa_pair_792:
  - text: and then he turned right around.
  utter_qa_pair_793:
  - text: maybe you're right.
  utter_qa_pair_794:
  - text: are you married?
  utter_qa_pair_795:
  - text: no. i'm divorced.
  utter_qa_pair_796:
  - text: when did you get divorced?
  utter_qa_pair_797:
  - text: i got divorced two years ago.
  utter_qa_pair_798:
  - text: why did you get divorced?
  utter_qa_pair_799:
  - text: my wife left me.
  utter_qa_pair_800:
  - text: why did she leave you?
  utter_qa_pair_801:
  - text: she said she didn't love me anymore.
  utter_qa_pair_802:
  - text: wow! that's terrible.
  utter_qa_pair_803:
  - text: yes, it was.
  utter_qa_pair_804:
  - text: why didn't she love you anymore?
  utter_qa_pair_805:
  - text: i'm bored.
  utter_qa_pair_806:
  - text: what's on tv?
  utter_qa_pair_807:
  - text: nothing.
  utter_qa_pair_808:
  - text: there must be something on tv!
  utter_qa_pair_809:
  - text: nothing that's interesting.
  utter_qa_pair_810:
  - text: what about that new game show?
  utter_qa_pair_811:
  - text: which one?
  utter_qa_pair_812:
  - text: '"deal or no deal"'
  utter_qa_pair_813:
  - text: tell me you're joking.
  utter_qa_pair_814:
  - text: i love that show.
  utter_qa_pair_815:
  - text: i watched it once. that was enough.
  utter_qa_pair_816:
  - text: i like living here.
  utter_qa_pair_817:
  - text: i agree. pasadena is a nice city.
  utter_qa_pair_818:
  - text: it's not too big.
  utter_qa_pair_819:
  - text: and it's not too small.
  utter_qa_pair_820:
  - text: it has great weather all year long.
  utter_qa_pair_821:
  - text: it has the rose parade.
  utter_qa_pair_822:
  - text: it has beautiful houses.
  utter_qa_pair_823:
  - text: it has wonderful restaurants.
  utter_qa_pair_824:
  - text: it has great schools.
  utter_qa_pair_825:
  - text: it's close to the mountains.
  utter_qa_pair_826:
  - text: the people are friendly.
  utter_qa_pair_827:
  - text: we need a new mattress.
  utter_qa_pair_828:
  - text: what's the matter with this one?
  utter_qa_pair_829:
  - text: it's not comfortable.
  utter_qa_pair_830:
  - text: it seems fine to me.
  utter_qa_pair_831:
  - text: i toss and turn all night.
  utter_qa_pair_832:
  - text: you should stop drinking coffee.
  utter_qa_pair_833:
  - text: look at these marks on my arms.
  utter_qa_pair_834:
  - text: what are they?
  utter_qa_pair_835:
  - text: they are bites.
  utter_qa_pair_836:
  - text: did the cat bite you?
  utter_qa_pair_837:
  - text: no. the bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
  utter_qa_pair_838:
  - text: my laptop is so slow.
  utter_qa_pair_839:
  - text: buy a new one.
  utter_qa_pair_840:
  - text: i would if i had the money.
  utter_qa_pair_841:
  - text: why is it so slow?
  utter_qa_pair_842:
  - text: that's a good question.
  utter_qa_pair_843:
  - text: did you take it to a computer shop?
  utter_qa_pair_844:
  - text: i would if i had the money.
  utter_qa_pair_845:
  - text: well, i guess you have to live with it.
  utter_qa_pair_846:
  - text: sometimes i want to throw it out the window.
  utter_qa_pair_847:
  - text: you don't want to do that.
  utter_qa_pair_848:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_849:
  - text: what's for dinner?
  utter_qa_pair_850:
  - text: i'm not sure.
  utter_qa_pair_851:
  - text: how about a pizza?
  utter_qa_pair_852:
  - text: you had pizza for lunch.
  utter_qa_pair_853:
  - text: but i love pizza.
  utter_qa_pair_854:
  - text: everybody loves pizza.
  utter_qa_pair_855:
  - text: so why can't i have pizza for dinner?
  utter_qa_pair_856:
  - text: because you need variety.
  utter_qa_pair_857:
  - text: what's "variety?
  utter_qa_pair_858:
  - text: different thingsÂ—not the same thing all the time.
  utter_qa_pair_859:
  - text: you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?
  utter_qa_pair_860:
  - text: we need to save money.
  utter_qa_pair_861:
  - text: why do we need to save money?
  utter_qa_pair_862:
  - text: because we need to buy a house.
  utter_qa_pair_863:
  - text: but a house is so expensive.
  utter_qa_pair_864:
  - text: that's why we need to save money.
  utter_qa_pair_865:
  - text: how much do we need to save?
  utter_qa_pair_866:
  - text: we need to save enough for a down payment.
  utter_qa_pair_867:
  - text: how much is that?
  utter_qa_pair_868:
  - text: that's about $30,000.
  utter_qa_pair_869:
  - text: thirty thousand dollars! that will take forever.
  utter_qa_pair_870:
  - text: not if we save every penny.
  utter_qa_pair_871:
  - text: the ocean is so big.
  utter_qa_pair_872:
  - text: you can't see the end of it.
  utter_qa_pair_873:
  - text: it goes on and on forever.
  utter_qa_pair_874:
  - text: and it's deep, too.
  utter_qa_pair_875:
  - text: i think it's five miles deep.
  utter_qa_pair_876:
  - text: are there fish at the bottom?
  utter_qa_pair_877:
  - text: there are fish at the top and the bottom.
  utter_qa_pair_878:
  - text: are there more fish or more people?
  utter_qa_pair_879:
  - text: i think there are more fish.
  utter_qa_pair_880:
  - text: i'm upset with my mom.
  utter_qa_pair_881:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_882:
  - text: i warned her about her new boyfriend. she didn't listen to me.
  utter_qa_pair_883:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_884:
  - text: i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself.
  utter_qa_pair_885:
  - text: that was very nice of you.
  utter_qa_pair_886:
  - text: i found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
  utter_qa_pair_887:
  - text: why did she do that?
  utter_qa_pair_888:
  - text: he said he would buy her a nice ring.
  utter_qa_pair_889:
  - text: what's wrong with that?
  utter_qa_pair_890:
  - text: he went to las vegas. he lost it all gambling.
  utter_qa_pair_891:
  - text: do animals talk to each other?
  utter_qa_pair_892:
  - text: of course they talk to each other.
  utter_qa_pair_893:
  - text: what do they talk about?
  utter_qa_pair_894:
  - text: they talk about other animals.
  utter_qa_pair_895:
  - text: what else do they talk about?
  utter_qa_pair_896:
  - text: they talk about food and the weather.
  utter_qa_pair_897:
  - text: do they talk about us?
  utter_qa_pair_898:
  - text: of course they talk about us.
  utter_qa_pair_899:
  - text: what do they say about us?
  utter_qa_pair_900:
  - text: they say that we are funny-looking.
  utter_qa_pair_901:
  - text: ha! we're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
  utter_qa_pair_902:
  - text: i have to clean the house.
  utter_qa_pair_903:
  - text: yes, it's very dirty.
  utter_qa_pair_904:
  - text: you can help me.
  utter_qa_pair_905:
  - text: why me?
  utter_qa_pair_906:
  - text: because you helped make it dirty.
  utter_qa_pair_907:
  - text: what do you want me to do?
  utter_qa_pair_908:
  - text: i want you to clean the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_909:
  - text: oh, that's easy.
  utter_qa_pair_910:
  - text: clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.
  utter_qa_pair_911:
  - text: that's a lot of work.
  utter_qa_pair_912:
  - text: tell me when you finish.
  utter_qa_pair_913:
  - text: you're watching too much tv.
  utter_qa_pair_914:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_915:
  - text: i mean you're wasting your life.
  utter_qa_pair_916:
  - text: i'm having fun.
  utter_qa_pair_917:
  - text: you're sitting there with your mouth open.
  utter_qa_pair_918:
  - text: who cares?
  utter_qa_pair_919:
  - text: i care. do something.
  utter_qa_pair_920:
  - text: okay. i did something.
  utter_qa_pair_921:
  - text: what did you do?
  utter_qa_pair_922:
  - text: i turned up the volume.
  utter_qa_pair_923:
  - text: that's not what i meant by "do something."
  utter_qa_pair_924:
  - text: did you write a letter to grandma?
  utter_qa_pair_925:
  - text: yes, i did.
  utter_qa_pair_926:
  - text: did you tell her about school?
  utter_qa_pair_927:
  - text: i told her that school is fun.
  utter_qa_pair_928:
  - text: did you put the letter in an envelope?
  utter_qa_pair_929:
  - text: yes, and i sealed the envelope.
  utter_qa_pair_930:
  - text: did you put a stamp on the envelope?
  utter_qa_pair_931:
  - text: i couldn't find any stamps.
  utter_qa_pair_932:
  - text: they're in the kitchen drawer.
  utter_qa_pair_933:
  - text: okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope.
  utter_qa_pair_934:
  - text: give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you.
  utter_qa_pair_935:
  - text: why are you yawning?
  utter_qa_pair_936:
  - text: i'm sleepy.
  utter_qa_pair_937:
  - text: why don't you go to bed?
  utter_qa_pair_938:
  - text: i want to watch this tv show.
  utter_qa_pair_939:
  - text: maybe you should record it.
  utter_qa_pair_940:
  - text: the tape recorder is broken.
  utter_qa_pair_941:
  - text: then you should watch the rerun.
  utter_qa_pair_942:
  - text: why? i'm watching the original.
  utter_qa_pair_943:
  - text: but you'll be asleep in about one minute.
  utter_qa_pair_944:
  - text: i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
  utter_qa_pair_945:
  - text: okay. i'll tell you how the show ends.
  utter_qa_pair_946:
  - text: it's sunday.
  utter_qa_pair_947:
  - text: so?
  utter_qa_pair_948:
  - text: you know what that means.
  utter_qa_pair_949:
  - text: i forgot.
  utter_qa_pair_950:
  - text: sunday means we go to church.
  utter_qa_pair_951:
  - text: oh, yeah.
  utter_qa_pair_952:
  - text: put on a coat and tie.
  utter_qa_pair_953:
  - text: why?
  utter_qa_pair_954:
  - text: to show respect to god and others.
  utter_qa_pair_955:
  - text: i'm glad sunday is only once a week.
  utter_qa_pair_956:
  - text: i hope god didn't hear that.
  utter_qa_pair_957:
  - text: did you feed the cat?
  utter_qa_pair_958:
  - text: i'll do that in a minute.
  utter_qa_pair_959:
  - text: the cat is meowing. he's hungry.
  utter_qa_pair_960:
  - text: okay. i'll feed him right now.
  utter_qa_pair_961:
  - text: you shouldn't make him wait.
  utter_qa_pair_962:
  - text: i was doing my homework.
  utter_qa_pair_963:
  - text: the cat doesn't care about your homework.
  utter_qa_pair_964:
  - text: the cat doesn't care about anything.
  utter_qa_pair_965:
  - text: that's the way cats are.
  utter_qa_pair_966:
  - text: all they think about is themselves.
  utter_qa_pair_967:
  - text: maybe we should get rid of him.
  utter_qa_pair_968:
  - text: i hate shaving.
  utter_qa_pair_969:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_970:
  - text: i just cut myself again.
  utter_qa_pair_971:
  - text: did you use a new blade?
  utter_qa_pair_972:
  - text: it doesn't matter. old blades cut, new blades cut.
  utter_qa_pair_973:
  - text: maybe you should use an electric shaver.
  utter_qa_pair_974:
  - text: they make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
  utter_qa_pair_975:
  - text: maybe you should stop shaving.
  utter_qa_pair_976:
  - text: and grow a beard?
  utter_qa_pair_977:
  - text: sure. why not?
  utter_qa_pair_978:
  - text: because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
  utter_qa_pair_979:
  - text: excuse me.
  utter_qa_pair_980:
  - text: yes?
  utter_qa_pair_981:
  - text: are you reading this paper?
  utter_qa_pair_982:
  - text: oh, no. help yourself.
  utter_qa_pair_983:
  - text: i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
  utter_qa_pair_984:
  - text: thank you. that's polite of you to ask.
  utter_qa_pair_985:
  - text: some people would just pick it up.
  utter_qa_pair_986:
  - text: yes, i know. some people are rude.
  utter_qa_pair_987:
  - text: i always try to be polite.
  utter_qa_pair_988:
  - text: so do i.
  utter_qa_pair_989:
  - text: the world needs more polite people like us.
  utter_qa_pair_990:
  - text: mom, i want a puppy.
  utter_qa_pair_991:
  - text: let me think about it.
  utter_qa_pair_992:
  - text: why do you have to think about it?
  utter_qa_pair_993:
  - text: because a puppy costs money.
  utter_qa_pair_994:
  - text: no, it doesn't. puppies are free.
  utter_qa_pair_995:
  - text: yes, but a puppy needs shots.
  utter_qa_pair_996:
  - text: shots for what?
  utter_qa_pair_997:
  - text: so it won't get sick. just like you get shots.
  utter_qa_pair_998:
  - text: i hate shots.
  utter_qa_pair_999:
  - text: and a puppy eats food. food costs money.
  utter_qa_pair_1000:
  - text: no problem. i'll give him food off my plate.
  utter_qa_pair_1001:
  - text: look at all these kittens!
  utter_qa_pair_1002:
  - text: how many are there?
  utter_qa_pair_1003:
  - text: eight.
  utter_qa_pair_1004:
  - text: they're all so cute.
  utter_qa_pair_1005:
  - text: yes, but i can't keep them.
  utter_qa_pair_1006:
  - text: what are you going to do with them?
  utter_qa_pair_1007:
  - text: i'm going to give them away. do you want one?
  utter_qa_pair_1008:
  - text: yes, i would love one.
  utter_qa_pair_1009:
  - text: which one do you want?
  utter_qa_pair_1010:
  - text: that one. the one that's all black.
  utter_qa_pair_1011:
  - text: yes, i like that one, too.
  utter_qa_pair_1012:
  - text: my parents go to church every sunday.
  utter_qa_pair_1013:
  - text: they trust in god.
  utter_qa_pair_1014:
  - text: they hope they will go to heaven.
  utter_qa_pair_1015:
  - text: they probably will.
  utter_qa_pair_1016:
  - text: but no one knows for sure.
  utter_qa_pair_1017:
  - text: that's for sure.
  utter_qa_pair_1018:
  - text: no one knows what happens after we die.
  utter_qa_pair_1019:
  - text: if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god.
  utter_qa_pair_1020:
  - text: that's what many people believe.
  utter_qa_pair_1021:
  - text: if we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.
  utter_qa_pair_1022:
  - text: i don't want to go to hell.
  utter_qa_pair_1023:
  - text: my husband died.
  utter_qa_pair_1024:
  - text: i'm sorry for you.
  utter_qa_pair_1025:
  - text: thank you.
  utter_qa_pair_1026:
  - text: when did he die?
  utter_qa_pair_1027:
  - text: a couple of months ago.
  utter_qa_pair_1028:
  - text: you still miss him.
  utter_qa_pair_1029:
  - text: yes, but i talk to him almost every day.
  utter_qa_pair_1030:
  - text: when you go to church?
  utter_qa_pair_1031:
  - text: no, when i call him on his cell phone.
  utter_qa_pair_1032:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1033:
  - text: i buried him with his cell phone.
  utter_qa_pair_1034:
  - text: today is friday the thirteenth.
  utter_qa_pair_1035:
  - text: that's a bad day.
  utter_qa_pair_1036:
  - text: it's supposed to be unlucky.
  utter_qa_pair_1037:
  - text: you're supposed to stay home all day.
  utter_qa_pair_1038:
  - text: that's what i do.
  utter_qa_pair_1039:
  - text: my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth.
  utter_qa_pair_1040:
  - text: that was a mistake.
  utter_qa_pair_1041:
  - text: he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
  utter_qa_pair_1042:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_1043:
  - text: someone stole his laptop.
  utter_qa_pair_1044:
  - text: he was asking for it.
  utter_qa_pair_1045:
  - text: do you really love me?
  utter_qa_pair_1046:
  - text: of course.
  utter_qa_pair_1047:
  - text: prove it.
  utter_qa_pair_1048:
  - text: how can i prove it?
  utter_qa_pair_1049:
  - text: take me to dinner.
  utter_qa_pair_1050:
  - text: that's it? that's all i have to do?
  utter_qa_pair_1051:
  - text: take me to a nice restaurant, not to mcdonald's.
  utter_qa_pair_1052:
  - text: but a nice restaurant costs money.
  utter_qa_pair_1053:
  - text: yes, and you have to make a reservation.
  utter_qa_pair_1054:
  - text: that's such a hassle.
  utter_qa_pair_1055:
  - text: i knew you didn't love me.
  utter_qa_pair_1056:
  - text: my parents are divorced.
  utter_qa_pair_1057:
  - text: so are mine.
  utter_qa_pair_1058:
  - text: why did your parents get divorced?
  utter_qa_pair_1059:
  - text: my father found a new girlfriend.
  utter_qa_pair_1060:
  - text: that's too bad.
  utter_qa_pair_1061:
  - text: my mother was hurt and angry.
  utter_qa_pair_1062:
  - text: she had good reason. what did she do?
  utter_qa_pair_1063:
  - text: she told him to drop his girlfriend.
  utter_qa_pair_1064:
  - text: what did your father do?
  utter_qa_pair_1065:
  - text: he moved out of our house.
  utter_qa_pair_1066:
  - text: i guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
  utter_qa_pair_1067:
  - text: my grandma's apartment smells funny.
  utter_qa_pair_1068:
  - text: so does mine.
  utter_qa_pair_1069:
  - text: i think it's an old people's smell.
  utter_qa_pair_1070:
  - text: really?
  utter_qa_pair_1071:
  - text: yes. i think when you get old, you begin to smell.
  utter_qa_pair_1072:
  - text: like fruit that is too ripe?
  utter_qa_pair_1073:
  - text: yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
  utter_qa_pair_1074:
  - text: but the smell is different.
  utter_qa_pair_1075:
  - text: yes, old people don't smell like fruit.
  utter_qa_pair_1076:
  - text: no, they smell like a thrift shop.
  utter_qa_pair_1077:
  - text: yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.
  utter_qa_pair_1078:
  - text: the price of stamps goes up and up.
  utter_qa_pair_1079:
  - text: i think stamps used to cost a penny.
  utter_qa_pair_1080:
  - text: that was a long time ago.
  utter_qa_pair_1081:
  - text: it was before i was born.
  utter_qa_pair_1082:
  - text: now a stamp is 42 cents.
  utter_qa_pair_1083:
  - text: but in may it will be 44 cents.
  utter_qa_pair_1084:
  - text: have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
  utter_qa_pair_1085:
  - text: no, i haven't.
  utter_qa_pair_1086:
  - text: neither have i.
  utter_qa_pair_1087:
  - text: so, they do a good job for the money.
  utter_qa_pair_1088:
  - text: yes, they do.
  utter_qa_pair_1089:
  - text: a button came off my shirt.
  utter_qa_pair_1090:
  - text: what are you going to do?
  utter_qa_pair_1091:
  - text: first, i have to find the button.
  utter_qa_pair_1092:
  - text: where did you lose it?
  utter_qa_pair_1093:
  - text: i have no idea.

  - text: that's a good idea.
  utter_qa_pair_1096:
  - text: i found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
  utter_qa_pair_1097:
  - text: let me look. no, it's not there.
  utter_qa_pair_1098:
  - text: many shirts come with an extra button.

  - text: you're right. this one does have an extra button.
  utter_qa_pair_1100:

  utter_qa_pair_1106:
  - text: have you looked in the mirror?
  utter_qa_pair_1107:
  - text: do you think i'm getting fat?
  utter_qa_pair_1108:
  - text: i didn't say that.
  utter_qa_pair_1109:
  - text: what did you say?
  utter_qa_pair_1110:
  - text: i said i have to go to the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_1111:
  - text: did you do the laundry?
  utter_qa_pair_1112:
  - text: yes, i did.
  utter_qa_pair_1113:

  utter_qa_pair_1114:
  - text: i washed the sheets and towels.

  utter_qa_pair_1117:

  utter_qa_pair_1121:
  - text: did you put the sheets on the beds?
  utter_qa_pair_1122:
  - text: do you listen to the radio?
  utter_qa_pair_1123:
  - text: i listen day and night.
  utter_qa_pair_1124:
  - text: what do you listen to?
  utter_qa_pair_1125:
  - text: mostly talk radio.
  utter_qa_pair_1126:
  - text: what's that?
  utter_qa_pair_1127:
  - text: people talk about current events.
  utter_qa_pair_1128:
  - text: what do they say?
  utter_qa_pair_1129:
  - text: they say they want change.
  utter_qa_pair_1130:
  - text: what kind of change?
  utter_qa_pair_1131:
  - text: they want tax cuts.
  utter_qa_pair_1132:
  - text: why do they want tax cuts?
  utter_qa_pair_1133:
  - text: mom, i'm hungry.
  utter_qa_pair_1134:
  - text: look in the fridge.
  utter_qa_pair_1135:
  - text: i'm looking. there's nothing to eat.
  utter_qa_pair_1136:
  - text: are you sure?
  utter_qa_pair_1137:
  - text: it's almost empty.
  utter_qa_pair_1138:
  - text: i went to the market yesterday.
  utter_qa_pair_1139:
  - text: i don't see anything.
  utter_qa_pair_1140:
  - text: i bought lots of oranges and apples.
  utter_qa_pair_1141:
  - text: i don't want fruit. i want something tasty.
  utter_qa_pair_1142:
  - text: eat the fruit. it's good for you.
  utter_qa_pair_1143:
  - text: next time you go to the market, let me go with you.
  utter_qa_pair_1144:
  - text: what is there to eat?
  utter_qa_pair_1145:
  - text: i don't know. look in the fridge.
  utter_qa_pair_1146:
  - text: i think i'll make a sandwich.
  utter_qa_pair_1147:
  - text: what kind?
  utter_qa_pair_1148:
  - text: a ham sandwich.
  utter_qa_pair_1149:
  - text: the bread is in the cabinet.
  utter_qa_pair_1150:
  - text: where's the mustard?
  utter_qa_pair_1151:
  - text: it's in the fridge, i think.
  utter_qa_pair_1152:
  - text: oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?
  utter_qa_pair_1153:
  - text: yes, that sounds nice.
  utter_qa_pair_1154:
  - text: how about some potato chips?
  utter_qa_pair_1155:
  - text: it's time for your bath, young lady.
  utter_qa_pair_1156:
  - text: but, mom, i'm not dirty.
  utter_qa_pair_1157:
  - text: you need a bath every day.
  utter_qa_pair_1158:
  - text: why?
  utter_qa_pair_1159:
  - text: because you don't want to smell bad.
  utter_qa_pair_1160:
  - text: i don't smell bad.
  utter_qa_pair_1161:
  - text: that's what you think.
  utter_qa_pair_1162:
  - text: if i smelled bad, i could smell me.
  utter_qa_pair_1163:
  - text: i can smell you.
  utter_qa_pair_1164:
  - text: i can smell you, too.
  utter_qa_pair_1165:
  - text: that's my perfume.
  utter_qa_pair_1166:
  - text: something's wrong with my computer.
  utter_qa_pair_1167:
  - text: exactly what?
  utter_qa_pair_1168:
  - text: all i get is a black screen.
  utter_qa_pair_1169:
  - text: what's the matter?
  utter_qa_pair_1170:
  - text: i think i know, because this happened before.
  utter_qa_pair_1171:
  - text: what happened before?
  utter_qa_pair_1172:
  - text: my hard drive crashed.
  utter_qa_pair_1173:
  - text: oh, no. that's bad news.
  utter_qa_pair_1174:
  - text: it sure is, but i'm going to call hp first, just to make sure.
  utter_qa_pair_1175:
  - text: will you lose all your files?
  utter_qa_pair_1176:
  - text: no, i always back up my files.
  utter_qa_pair_1177:
  - text: i called hp about my computer.
  utter_qa_pair_1178:
  - text: what did they say?
  utter_qa_pair_1179:
  - text: they said i need a new hard drive.
  utter_qa_pair_1180:
  - text: that's too bad. how much is a new one?
  utter_qa_pair_1181:
  - text: it's not too much, only about $85.
  utter_qa_pair_1182:
  - text: plus installation?
  utter_qa_pair_1183:
  - text: no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.
  utter_qa_pair_1184:
  - text: really?
  utter_qa_pair_1185:
  - text: yes, it's just a couple of screws.
  utter_qa_pair_1186:
  - text: that's nice.
  utter_qa_pair_1187:
  - text: it's a lot better than paying someone $60.
  utter_qa_pair_1188:
  - text: what's your email address?
  utter_qa_pair_1189:
  - text: it's bluedog123.
  utter_qa_pair_1190:
  - text: bluedog123. are you sure that's all?
  utter_qa_pair_1191:
  - text: yes.
  utter_qa_pair_1192:
  - text: no. that's incomplete.
  utter_qa_pair_1193:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1194:
  - text: what's your mailing address?
  utter_qa_pair_1195:
  - text: 456 cherry drive, pasadena, ca 91170.
  utter_qa_pair_1196:
  - text: that's correct.
  utter_qa_pair_1197:
  - text: so what's the problem?
  utter_qa_pair_1198:
  - text: bluedog123 is just the street. you have to give me the city, state, and
      zip code.
  utter_qa_pair_1199:
  - text: i'm going to take a nap.
  utter_qa_pair_1200:
  - text: you should unplug the phone.
  utter_qa_pair_1201:
  - text: that's a good idea.
  utter_qa_pair_1202:
  - text: do you want me to wake you in an hour?
  utter_qa_pair_1203:
  - text: no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up.
  utter_qa_pair_1204:
  - text: i'll start dinner at 6:00.
  utter_qa_pair_1205:
  - text: okay. i think i'll be awake by then.
  utter_qa_pair_1206:
  - text: if not, your nose will wake you up.
  utter_qa_pair_1207:
  - text: you mean i will smell the food cooking?
  utter_qa_pair_1208:
  - text: you might even dream about dinner.
  utter_qa_pair_1209:
  - text: i don't think i'm going to dream about anything. i'm really tired.
  utter_qa_pair_1210:
  - text: that was a nice funeral.
  utter_qa_pair_1211:
  - text: yes, dad, it was.
  utter_qa_pair_1212:
  - text: the son gave a nice speech about his father.
  utter_qa_pair_1213:
  - text: it was long, too.
  utter_qa_pair_1214:
  - text: i think it was about 45 minutes long.
  utter_qa_pair_1215:
  - text: but it went by fast. it was interesting.
  utter_qa_pair_1216:
  - text: i liked it.
  utter_qa_pair_1217:
  - text: i'll give you a speech like that, too.
  utter_qa_pair_1218:
  - text: do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
  utter_qa_pair_1219:
  - text: of course.
  utter_qa_pair_1220:
  - text: i think only the family will be there.
  utter_qa_pair_1221:
  - text: yikes! what was that noise?
  utter_qa_pair_1222:
  - text: i had to blow my nose.
  utter_qa_pair_1223:
  - text: did you have to blow right next to the phone?
  utter_qa_pair_1224:
  - text: did you hear that?
  utter_qa_pair_1225:
  - text: of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.
  utter_qa_pair_1226:
  - text: it wasn't that loud.
  utter_qa_pair_1227:
  - text: i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.
  utter_qa_pair_1228:
  - text: okay. i'll take your word for it.
  utter_qa_pair_1229:
  - text: i thought you had an elephant in your house.
  utter_qa_pair_1230:
  - text: you're funny.
  utter_qa_pair_1231:
  - text: what did you say? i think i've gone deaf.
  utter_qa_pair_1232:
  - text: i have lots of friends.
  utter_qa_pair_1233:
  - text: really? how many do you have?
  utter_qa_pair_1234:
  - text: i don't know, maybe one hundred.
  utter_qa_pair_1235:
  - text: that is a lot of friends. do you have a best friend?
  utter_qa_pair_1236:
  - text: of course. i have lots of best friends.
  utter_qa_pair_1237:
  - text: how many best friends do you have?
  utter_qa_pair_1238:
  - text: i think about twenty-five.
  utter_qa_pair_1239:
  - text: hmm. i have only one best friend.
  utter_qa_pair_1240:
  - text: i feel sorry for you.
  utter_qa_pair_1241:
  - text: i have only a few friends.
  utter_qa_pair_1242:
  - text: you must be lonely. i will share my friends with you.
  utter_qa_pair_1243:
  - text: don't you ever cheat on me.
  utter_qa_pair_1244:
  - text: why would i do that?
  utter_qa_pair_1245:
  - text: because men like to cheat.
  utter_qa_pair_1246:
  - text: some men do, but not me.
  utter_qa_pair_1247:
  - text: i'm watching you.
  utter_qa_pair_1248:
  - text: i'm an open book. watch me all you want.
  utter_qa_pair_1249:
  - text: if i catch you, you'll be sorry.
  utter_qa_pair_1250:
  - text: you won't catch me, because i love you. i'm not a cheater.
  utter_qa_pair_1251:
  - text: i will poke your eyes out.
  utter_qa_pair_1252:
  - text: i don't want any other woman.
  utter_qa_pair_1253:
  - text: i will chop your toes off, one by one.
  utter_qa_pair_1254:
  - text: i hate to go outside.
  utter_qa_pair_1255:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_1256:
  - text: why do you hate to go outside?
  utter_qa_pair_1257:
  - text: i meet too many jerks.
  utter_qa_pair_1258:
  - text: i agree.
  utter_qa_pair_1259:
  - text: this city is full of jerks.
  utter_qa_pair_1260:
  - text: rude people are everywhere.
  utter_qa_pair_1261:
  - text: but what can you do?
  utter_qa_pair_1262:
  - text: you can yell at them.
  utter_qa_pair_1263:
  - text: and they will yell back at you.
  utter_qa_pair_1264:
  - text: yelling doesn't do any good.
  utter_qa_pair_1265:
  - text: will you look at this form?
  utter_qa_pair_1266:
  - text: are you having problems with it?
  utter_qa_pair_1267:
  - text: i don't understand some things.
  utter_qa_pair_1268:
  - text: let me help you.
  utter_qa_pair_1269:
  - text: what does "mi" mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1270:
  - text: '"mi" stands for middle initial.'
  utter_qa_pair_1271:
  - text: what does "mm/dd/yy" mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1272:
  - text: that means month/day/year. use numbers.
  utter_qa_pair_1273:
  - text: i don't understand.
  utter_qa_pair_1274:
  - text: for example, if your birth date is january 12, 1987, write 01/12/87.
  utter_qa_pair_1275:
  - text: oh. that's simple enough.
  utter_qa_pair_1276:
  - text: let's go to the animal shelter.
  utter_qa_pair_1277:
  - text: what do you want to do?
  utter_qa_pair_1278:
  - text: i want to get a puppy for my son.
  utter_qa_pair_1279:
  - text: that will make him so happy.
  utter_qa_pair_1280:
  - text: i'll get him one of those little dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_1281:
  - text: one that won't grow up too big.
  utter_qa_pair_1282:
  - text: and eat too much.
  utter_qa_pair_1283:
  - text: do you know which one he would like?
  utter_qa_pair_1284:
  - text: oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked.
  utter_qa_pair_1285:
  - text: i bet you had to drag him away.
  utter_qa_pair_1286:
  - text: he wanted to take it home yesterday.
  utter_qa_pair_1287:
  - text: what's the weather like?
  utter_qa_pair_1288:
  - text: i don't know. i just woke up.
  utter_qa_pair_1289:
  - text: why don't you look outside?
  utter_qa_pair_1290:
  - text: okay. it looks like rain.
  utter_qa_pair_1291:
  - text: why do you say that?
  utter_qa_pair_1292:
  - text: the sky is gray.
  utter_qa_pair_1293:
  - text: is it raining right now?
  utter_qa_pair_1294:
  - text: no.
  utter_qa_pair_1295:
  - text: how do you know?
  utter_qa_pair_1296:
  - text: the street isn't wet.
  utter_qa_pair_1297:
  - text: i have to go shopping today.
  utter_qa_pair_1298:
  - text: i can't believe how hot it is.
  utter_qa_pair_1299:
  - text: it's not even noon yet.
  utter_qa_pair_1300:
  - text: that means it will get hotter.
  utter_qa_pair_1301:
  - text: i am dying from the heat.
  utter_qa_pair_1302:
  - text: turn on the air conditioner.
  utter_qa_pair_1303:
  - text: it doesn't work.
  utter_qa_pair_1304:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_1305:
  - text: i don't know.
  utter_qa_pair_1306:
  - text: did you call the repairman?
  utter_qa_pair_1307:
  - text: of course.
  utter_qa_pair_1308:
  - text: when is he coming?
  utter_qa_pair_1309:
  - text: i'll be glad when winter comes.
  utter_qa_pair_1310:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_1311:
  - text: because i love the snow.
  utter_qa_pair_1312:
  - text: yes, the snow is fun.
  utter_qa_pair_1313:
  - text: last year we made a big snowman.
  utter_qa_pair_1314:
  - text: how big was it?
  utter_qa_pair_1315:
  - text: it was seven feet tall.
  utter_qa_pair_1316:
  - text: how long did it take?
  utter_qa_pair_1317:
  - text: it took us all day.
  utter_qa_pair_1318:
  - text: did you give him a nose?
  utter_qa_pair_1319:
  - text: of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose.
  utter_qa_pair_1320:
  - text: i'm going to the bank.
  utter_qa_pair_1321:
  - text: what do you need to do?
  utter_qa_pair_1322:
  - text: i need to withdraw some money.
  utter_qa_pair_1323:
  - text: how are you going to do that?
  utter_qa_pair_1324:
  - text: i'll just use the atm.
  utter_qa_pair_1325:
  - text: what's that?
  utter_qa_pair_1326:
  - text: it's the automatic teller machine.
  utter_qa_pair_1327:
  - text: it gives you money?
  utter_qa_pair_1328:
  - text: i just insert my debit card into the machine.
  utter_qa_pair_1329:
  - text: and it gives you money?
  utter_qa_pair_1330:
  - text: well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.
  utter_qa_pair_1331:
  - text: did you put the blue bin out on the street?
  utter_qa_pair_1332:
  - text: oh, no. i forgot.
  utter_qa_pair_1333:
  - text: well, you'd better take it out front.
  utter_qa_pair_1334:
  - text: what time does the recycle truck come by?
  utter_qa_pair_1335:
  - text: it usually gets here at noon on tuesday, which is tomorrow.
  utter_qa_pair_1336:
  - text: i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
  utter_qa_pair_1337:
  - text: oh, no, you don't.
  utter_qa_pair_1338:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1339:
  - text: every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
  utter_qa_pair_1340:
  - text: do you think i'll forget to do it?
  utter_qa_pair_1341:
  - text: you'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.
  utter_qa_pair_1342:
  - text: are you ready?
  utter_qa_pair_1343:
  - text: ready for what?
  utter_qa_pair_1344:
  - text: ready for the big switch.
  utter_qa_pair_1345:
  - text: what are you talking about?
  utter_qa_pair_1346:
  - text: the nation is switching to digital tv.
  utter_qa_pair_1347:
  - text: oh. of course i'm ready.
  utter_qa_pair_1348:
  - text: did you buy the converter?
  utter_qa_pair_1349:
  - text: no, i don't need a converter because i bought a digital tv.
  utter_qa_pair_1350:
  - text: how much was that?
  utter_qa_pair_1351:
  - text: it was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
  utter_qa_pair_1352:
  - text: does it pick up any digital channels?
  utter_qa_pair_1353:
  - text: people are funny.
  utter_qa_pair_1354:
  - text: they sure are.
  utter_qa_pair_1355:
  - text: did you hear about the pilot?
  utter_qa_pair_1356:
  - text: the one that stole a small plane?
  utter_qa_pair_1357:
  - text: yes, he stole a plane in canada and flew into the u.s.
  utter_qa_pair_1358:
  - text: did they catch him?
  utter_qa_pair_1359:
  - text: yes. after two u.s. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on
      a highway.
  utter_qa_pair_1360:
  - text: did he crash?
  utter_qa_pair_1361:
  - text: no, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_1362:
  - text: did the cops find out why he flew into the u.s.?
  utter_qa_pair_1363:
  - text: his life sucked. he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
  utter_qa_pair_1364:
  - text: the police need our help finding a robber.
  utter_qa_pair_1365:
  - text: how do you know?
  utter_qa_pair_1366:
  - text: the tv news is reporting a bank robbery.
  utter_qa_pair_1367:
  - text: do they know what the robber looks like?
  utter_qa_pair_1368:
  - text: yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
  utter_qa_pair_1369:
  - text: what race is he?
  utter_qa_pair_1370:
  - text: they didn't say.
  utter_qa_pair_1371:
  - text: the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
  utter_qa_pair_1372:
  - text: of course not. that would be racist.
  utter_qa_pair_1373:
  - text: but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
  utter_qa_pair_1374:
  - text: don't ask me.
  utter_qa_pair_1375:
  - text: don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
  utter_qa_pair_1376:
  - text: but i don't have a tissue.
  utter_qa_pair_1377:
  - text: then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_1378:
  - text: i didn't have time to get one from there.
  utter_qa_pair_1379:
  - text: your sleeves are not tissues.
  utter_qa_pair_1380:
  - text: but mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
  utter_qa_pair_1381:
  - text: that doesn't make it right.
  utter_qa_pair_1382:
  - text: i saw dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
  utter_qa_pair_1383:
  - text: i will talk to your father about that.
  utter_qa_pair_1384:
  - text: i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.
  utter_qa_pair_1385:
  - text: your daddy was a good little boy.
  utter_qa_pair_1386:
  - text: i'm worried.
  utter_qa_pair_1387:
  - text: worried about what?
  utter_qa_pair_1388:
  - text: i'm getting married.
  utter_qa_pair_1389:
  - text: you should be happy, not worried.
  utter_qa_pair_1390:
  - text: i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
  utter_qa_pair_1391:
  - text: yes, you have to take care of your wife.
  utter_qa_pair_1392:
  - text: and i have to take care of our children.
  utter_qa_pair_1393:
  - text: are you going to start a family?
  utter_qa_pair_1394:
  - text: yes. we want to have a little boy and a little girl.
  utter_qa_pair_1395:
  - text: that sounds wonderful.
  utter_qa_pair_1396:
  - text: except we can't afford it!
  utter_qa_pair_1397:
  - text: i don't get art.
  utter_qa_pair_1398:
  - text: or artists.
  utter_qa_pair_1399:
  - text: they're in a different world.
  utter_qa_pair_1400:
  - text: i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
  utter_qa_pair_1401:
  - text: the artist said the jar was both full and empty.
  utter_qa_pair_1402:
  - text: but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?
  utter_qa_pair_1403:
  - text: artists see things differently.
  utter_qa_pair_1404:
  - text: did you ever see anything that picasso painted?
  utter_qa_pair_1405:
  - text: of course! he's world famous.
  utter_qa_pair_1406:
  - text: did he ever take art lessons?
  utter_qa_pair_1407:
  - text: i can't believe it. i drew paintings like that in third grade.
  utter_qa_pair_1408:
  - text: what's the point?
  utter_qa_pair_1409:
  - text: the point of what?
  utter_qa_pair_1410:
  - text: of living.
  utter_qa_pair_1411:
  - text: who knows? you live, and then you die.
  utter_qa_pair_1412:
  - text: we must be here for some reason.
  utter_qa_pair_1413:
  - text: maybe we're here to have fun.
  utter_qa_pair_1414:
  - text: then why aren't i having fun?
  utter_qa_pair_1415:
  - text: because you're thinking too much.
  utter_qa_pair_1416:
  - text: so i should stop thinking?
  utter_qa_pair_1417:
  - text: stop thinking about what the point is.
  utter_qa_pair_1418:
  - text: okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.
  utter_qa_pair_1419:
  - text: beer is a powerful drug.
  utter_qa_pair_1420:
  - text: so are cigarettes.
  utter_qa_pair_1421:
  - text: which would you prefer?
  utter_qa_pair_1422:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1423:
  - text: when you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
  utter_qa_pair_1424:
  - text: i could pick only one or the other?
  utter_qa_pair_1425:
  - text: yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
  utter_qa_pair_1426:
  - text: boy, that's a tough one.
  utter_qa_pair_1427:
  - text: what's so tough about it? of course, i would pick cigarettes.
  utter_qa_pair_1428:
  - text: but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
  utter_qa_pair_1429:
  - text: well, you can't have everything.
  utter_qa_pair_1430:
  - text: my pants have a hole in the front pocket.
  utter_qa_pair_1431:
  - text: you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
  utter_qa_pair_1432:
  - text: yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
  utter_qa_pair_1433:
  - text: lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
  utter_qa_pair_1434:
  - text: who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
  utter_qa_pair_1435:
  - text: criminals, of course.
  utter_qa_pair_1436:
  - text: anyway, i have to fix the hole.
  utter_qa_pair_1437:
  - text: you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
  utter_qa_pair_1438:
  - text: tell me about this patch.
  utter_qa_pair_1439:
  - text: the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
  utter_qa_pair_1440:
  - text: that sounds a lot easier than sewing.
  utter_qa_pair_1441:
  - text: do you know any good jokes?
  utter_qa_pair_1442:
  - text: i can't remember jokes.
  utter_qa_pair_1443:
  - text: neither can i.
  utter_qa_pair_1444:
  - text: they go in one ear and out the other.
  utter_qa_pair_1445:
  - text: who makes up all these jokes?
  utter_qa_pair_1446:
  - text: who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.
  utter_qa_pair_1447:
  - text: yes, just in english alone.
  utter_qa_pair_1448:
  - text: i wonder if every language has jokes.
  utter_qa_pair_1449:
  - text: of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
  utter_qa_pair_1450:
  - text: what do you think people joke about the most?
  utter_qa_pair_1451:
  - text: i think most jokes are about women.
  utter_qa_pair_1452:
  - text: you're very lucky.
  utter_qa_pair_1453:
  - text: why do you say that?
  utter_qa_pair_1454:
  - text: you speak two languages.
  utter_qa_pair_1455:
  - text: well, my english isn't perfect.
  utter_qa_pair_1456:
  - text: no one speaks perfect english.
  utter_qa_pair_1457:
  - text: maybe i will be the first!
  utter_qa_pair_1458:
  - text: i've been thinking about learning spanish.
  utter_qa_pair_1459:
  - text: spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
  utter_qa_pair_1460:
  - text: how long will it take me to learn?
  utter_qa_pair_1461:
  - text: i think it will only take you a year or two.
  utter_qa_pair_1462:
  - text: how soon can we begin?
  utter_qa_pair_1463:
  - text: do you know what today is?
  utter_qa_pair_1464:
  - text: yes, it's april 22.
  utter_qa_pair_1465:
  - text: it's more than just a date.
  utter_qa_pair_1466:
  - text: is it your birthday or anniversary?
  utter_qa_pair_1467:
  - text: no, it's earth day.
  utter_qa_pair_1468:
  - text: what's that?
  utter_qa_pair_1469:
  - text: it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
  utter_qa_pair_1470:
  - text: oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
  utter_qa_pair_1471:
  - text: yes. we need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
  utter_qa_pair_1472:
  - text: how about if i take shorter showers?
  utter_qa_pair_1473:
  - text: that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
  utter_qa_pair_1474:
  - text: poetry sucks.
  utter_qa_pair_1475:
  - text: i don't know anyone who likes it.
  utter_qa_pair_1476:
  - text: some of it is okay, i guess.
  utter_qa_pair_1477:
  - text: yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
  utter_qa_pair_1478:
  - text: like "one, two, buckle my shoe."
  utter_qa_pair_1479:
  - text: but people still write poems.
  utter_qa_pair_1480:
  - text: no one makes any money at it.
  utter_qa_pair_1481:
  - text: shakespeare was a poet.
  utter_qa_pair_1482:
  - text: did he get rich from his poetry?
  utter_qa_pair_1483:
  - text: probably not.
  utter_qa_pair_1484:
  - text: poems are a little bit like songs.
  utter_qa_pair_1485:
  - text: how smart are you?
  utter_qa_pair_1486:
  - text: i don't know. i think i'm average.
  utter_qa_pair_1487:
  - text: did you ever take an iq test?
  utter_qa_pair_1488:
  - text: no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school.
  utter_qa_pair_1489:
  - text: i wish i was really smart.
  utter_qa_pair_1490:
  - text: don't be ridiculous.
  utter_qa_pair_1491:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1492:
  - text: if you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
  utter_qa_pair_1493:
  - text: don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
  utter_qa_pair_1494:
  - text: it must be very lonely.
  utter_qa_pair_1495:
  - text: why's that?
  utter_qa_pair_1496:
  - text: i missed the tv news last night. what was on?
  utter_qa_pair_1497:
  - text: nothing that would pass as news.
  utter_qa_pair_1498:
  - text: what's the weather going to be like this weekend?
  utter_qa_pair_1499:
  - text: i don't know. whenever the weather comes on, i switch channels.
  utter_qa_pair_1500:
  - text: what was the lead story on the news?
  utter_qa_pair_1501:
  - text: some actress was in court for driving without a license.
  utter_qa_pair_1502:
  - text: what was the second story?
  utter_qa_pair_1503:
  - text: some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
  utter_qa_pair_1504:
  - text: what was the third story?
  utter_qa_pair_1505:
  - text: a bull chased a man in a supermarket.
  utter_qa_pair_1506:
  - text: wasn't there anything about octo-mom?
  utter_qa_pair_1507:
  - text: what are you going to do about your death?
  utter_qa_pair_1508:
  - text: well, mostly i'll try to avoid it.
  utter_qa_pair_1509:
  - text: i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
  utter_qa_pair_1510:
  - text: my wife and i will be cremated.
  utter_qa_pair_1511:
  - text: are you going to be buried next to each other?
  utter_qa_pair_1512:
  - text: oh, no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
  utter_qa_pair_1513:
  - text: you're not going to be buried?
  utter_qa_pair_1514:
  - text: a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
  utter_qa_pair_1515:
  - text: yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
  utter_qa_pair_1516:
  - text: children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
  utter_qa_pair_1517:
  - text: that's true. a cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
  utter_qa_pair_1518:
  - text: did you wipe your feet?
  utter_qa_pair_1519:
  - text: yes, of course i wiped my feet.
  utter_qa_pair_1520:
  - text: then why is there mud on the carpet?
  utter_qa_pair_1521:
  - text: i don't know. it's not my mud.
  utter_qa_pair_1522:
  - text: well, someone brought it into the house.
  utter_qa_pair_1523:
  - text: look at the bottom of my shoesÂ—they're clean.
  utter_qa_pair_1524:
  - text: of course they're clean. you left all the mud on the carpet.
  utter_qa_pair_1525:
  - text: okay, i'll get the vacuum cleaner.
  utter_qa_pair_1526:
  - text: don't vacuum it now.
  utter_qa_pair_1527:
  - text: don't you want me to clean up the mud?
  utter_qa_pair_1528:
  - text: wait till it dries. it will be easier to vacuum.
  utter_qa_pair_1529:
  - text: what are you getting for your mom?
  utter_qa_pair_1530:
  - text: what are you talking about?
  utter_qa_pair_1531:
  - text: sunday is mother's day.
  utter_qa_pair_1532:
  - text: this sunday?
  utter_qa_pair_1533:
  - text: of course. it's all over the news.
  utter_qa_pair_1534:
  - text: i thought it was next sunday.
  utter_qa_pair_1535:
  - text: well, you'd better get her something.
  utter_qa_pair_1536:
  - text: i'll get her a nice card.
  utter_qa_pair_1537:
  - text: is that it?
  utter_qa_pair_1538:
  - text: yes. that's all i ever give her.
  utter_qa_pair_1539:
  - text: she raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
  utter_qa_pair_1540:
  - text: i don't like our flag.
  utter_qa_pair_1541:
  - text: what's the matter with it?
  utter_qa_pair_1542:
  - text: it's too much like other flags.
  utter_qa_pair_1543:
  - text: yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
  utter_qa_pair_1544:
  - text: a flag should be pretty.
  utter_qa_pair_1545:
  - text: what should our flag look like?
  utter_qa_pair_1546:
  - text: it should have a pretty woman on it.
  utter_qa_pair_1547:
  - text: that's ridiculous!
  utter_qa_pair_1548:
  - text: you don't like pretty women?
  utter_qa_pair_1549:
  - text: of course i do. but not on our flag!
  utter_qa_pair_1550:
  - text: every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
  utter_qa_pair_1551:
  - text: i had a busy morning.
  utter_qa_pair_1552:
  - text: what did you do?
  utter_qa_pair_1553:
  - text: i watered all the plants.
  utter_qa_pair_1554:
  - text: you have a lot of plants.
  utter_qa_pair_1555:
  - text: then i did my laundry.
  utter_qa_pair_1556:
  - text: that takes some time.
  utter_qa_pair_1557:
  - text: i took the dog for a walk.
  utter_qa_pair_1558:
  - text: i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
  utter_qa_pair_1559:
  - text: i vacuumed the entire house.
  utter_qa_pair_1560:
  - text: that's a lot of work.
  utter_qa_pair_1561:
  - text: and then i made lunch.
  utter_qa_pair_1562:
  - text: i don't have long distance service with my home phone.
  utter_qa_pair_1563:
  - text: so how do you make long distance calls?
  utter_qa_pair_1564:
  - text: i use a calling card.
  utter_qa_pair_1565:
  - text: where do you get that?
  utter_qa_pair_1566:
  - text: i buy it at the dollar store.
  utter_qa_pair_1567:
  - text: how much is it?
  utter_qa_pair_1568:
  - text: it's one dollar for 100 minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_1569:
  - text: that's only a penny a minute!
  utter_qa_pair_1570:
  - text: it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.
  utter_qa_pair_1571:
  - text: how many?
  utter_qa_pair_1572:
  - text: first you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
  utter_qa_pair_1573:
  - text: do you go to college?
  utter_qa_pair_1574:
  - text: yes, i do.
  utter_qa_pair_1575:
  - text: what college do you go to?
  utter_qa_pair_1576:
  - text: i go to pasadena city college.
  utter_qa_pair_1577:
  - text: do you like it?
  utter_qa_pair_1578:
  - text: oh, yes, i really like it.
  utter_qa_pair_1579:
  - text: why do you like it?
  utter_qa_pair_1580:
  - text: because it has great teachers.
  utter_qa_pair_1581:
  - text: what else?
  utter_qa_pair_1582:
  - text: i like all my classmates, too.
  utter_qa_pair_1583:
  - text: anything else?
  utter_qa_pair_1584:
  - text: i lost my new pen.
  utter_qa_pair_1585:
  - text: where did you lose it?
  utter_qa_pair_1586:
  - text: i don't know.
  utter_qa_pair_1587:
  - text: when did you lose it?
  utter_qa_pair_1588:
  - text: i think i lost it today. i used it yesterday.
  utter_qa_pair_1589:
  - text: did you check all your pockets?
  utter_qa_pair_1590:
  - text: i checked all my pockets.
  utter_qa_pair_1591:
  - text: did you look in your desk?
  utter_qa_pair_1592:
  - text: yes. it isn't there, either.
  utter_qa_pair_1593:
  - text: it's probably around somewhere.
  utter_qa_pair_1594:
  - text: oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.
  utter_qa_pair_1595:
  - text: gravity is very important.
  utter_qa_pair_1596:
  - text: what is gravity?
  utter_qa_pair_1597:
  - text: it's the force that pulls everything down.
  utter_qa_pair_1598:
  - text: i don't understand.
  utter_qa_pair_1599:
  - text: if you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
  utter_qa_pair_1600:
  - text: of course it does.
  utter_qa_pair_1601:
  - text: without gravity, the water would go up.
  utter_qa_pair_1602:
  - text: you're joking.
  utter_qa_pair_1603:
  - text: without gravity, you would go up.
  utter_qa_pair_1604:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1605:
  - text: you would float into the sky like a balloon.
  utter_qa_pair_1606:
  - text: i can't read my book.
  utter_qa_pair_1607:
  - text: turn on the light.
  utter_qa_pair_1608:
  - text: the light is on.
  utter_qa_pair_1609:
  - text: open the book.
  utter_qa_pair_1610:
  - text: the book is open.
  utter_qa_pair_1611:
  - text: see an eye doctor.
  utter_qa_pair_1612:
  - text: that's what i need to do.
  utter_qa_pair_1613:
  - text: he'll give you a prescription for glasses.
  utter_qa_pair_1614:
  - text: i'll make an appointment tomorrow.
  utter_qa_pair_1615:
  - text: i'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
  utter_qa_pair_1616:
  - text: read the phone number to me.
  utter_qa_pair_1617:
  - text: what do you need for school?
  utter_qa_pair_1618:
  - text: i need pencils.
  utter_qa_pair_1619:
  - text: anything else?
  utter_qa_pair_1620:
  - text: i need a notebook.
  utter_qa_pair_1621:
  - text: do you need a pen?
  utter_qa_pair_1622:
  - text: no. i already have a pen.
  utter_qa_pair_1623:
  - text: do you need a calculator?
  utter_qa_pair_1624:
  - text: no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.
  utter_qa_pair_1625:
  - text: how about a dictionary?
  utter_qa_pair_1626:
  - text: no, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.
  utter_qa_pair_1627:
  - text: well, i guess that's it.
  utter_qa_pair_1628:
  - text: i like this magazine.
  utter_qa_pair_1629:
  - text: so do i.
  utter_qa_pair_1630:
  - text: i read it once, and i subscribed.
  utter_qa_pair_1631:
  - text: it gives you all the news.
  utter_qa_pair_1632:
  - text: all the news in only 50 pages.
  utter_qa_pair_1633:
  - text: i like the political cartoons.
  utter_qa_pair_1634:
  - text: i like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.
  utter_qa_pair_1635:
  - text: i always read the film reviews.
  utter_qa_pair_1636:
  - text: i never miss the food and drink section.
  utter_qa_pair_1637:
  - text: i gave a subscription to my parents.
  utter_qa_pair_1638:
  - text: me too. they canceled their other news magazines.
  utter_qa_pair_1639:
  - text: my pen is out of ink.
  utter_qa_pair_1640:
  - text: shake it a couple of times.
  utter_qa_pair_1641:
  - text: i shook it. there is no more ink.
  utter_qa_pair_1642:
  - text: you can borrow mine.
  utter_qa_pair_1643:
  - text: thank you. i'll buy a new one tomorrow.
  utter_qa_pair_1644:
  - text: what were you doing?
  utter_qa_pair_1645:
  - text: i was writing a letter.
  utter_qa_pair_1646:
  - text: who were you writing to?
  utter_qa_pair_1647:
  - text: it's to my mom.
  utter_qa_pair_1648:
  - text: tell her i said hello.
  utter_qa_pair_1649:
  - text: okay. i'll return your pen when i'm done.
  utter_qa_pair_1650:
  - text: have you done your homework?
  utter_qa_pair_1651:
  - text: not yet.
  utter_qa_pair_1652:
  - text: then why are you watching tv?
  utter_qa_pair_1653:
  - text: this is my favorite show.
  utter_qa_pair_1654:
  - text: go do your homework.
  utter_qa_pair_1655:
  - text: but, mom!
  utter_qa_pair_1656:
  - text: you can watch tv after you do your homework.
  utter_qa_pair_1657:
  - text: but the show will be over.
  utter_qa_pair_1658:
  - text: there will be another show next week.
  utter_qa_pair_1659:
  - text: please?
  utter_qa_pair_1660:
  - text: you know the rules.
  utter_qa_pair_1661:
  - text: i can't wait until i graduate.
  utter_qa_pair_1662:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_1663:
  - text: no more homework.
  utter_qa_pair_1664:
  - text: i hate homework.
  utter_qa_pair_1665:
  - text: are you going to college?
  utter_qa_pair_1666:
  - text: i can't afford it.
  utter_qa_pair_1667:
  - text: me neither.
  utter_qa_pair_1668:
  - text: so what are you going to do?
  utter_qa_pair_1669:
  - text: i'm joining the army.
  utter_qa_pair_1670:
  - text: you're kidding. you might get killed.
  utter_qa_pair_1671:
  - text: i don't think so. after i finish, i'll have enough money to go to college.
  utter_qa_pair_1672:
  - text: what is your major?
  utter_qa_pair_1673:
  - text: english.
  utter_qa_pair_1674:
  - text: what are you going to do with an english major?
  utter_qa_pair_1675:
  - text: i'm going to be a teacher.
  utter_qa_pair_1676:
  - text: high school or middle school?
  utter_qa_pair_1677:
  - text: high school.
  utter_qa_pair_1678:
  - text: i teach high school english.
  utter_qa_pair_1679:
  - text: i didn't know that.
  utter_qa_pair_1680:
  - text: i started teaching five years ago.
  utter_qa_pair_1681:
  - text: how do you like it?
  utter_qa_pair_1682:
  - text: do you see all this gray hair? it was totally black five years ago.
  utter_qa_pair_1683:
  - text: parking at school is impossible.
  utter_qa_pair_1684:
  - text: i'll say.
  utter_qa_pair_1685:
  - text: i drove around for half an hour.
  utter_qa_pair_1686:
  - text: did you find a spot?
  utter_qa_pair_1687:
  - text: i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.
  utter_qa_pair_1688:
  - text: did you yell at them?
  utter_qa_pair_1689:
  - text: yes, i did.
  utter_qa_pair_1690:
  - text: and?
  utter_qa_pair_1691:
  - text: and he yelled back at me.
  utter_qa_pair_1692:
  - text: how rude.
  utter_qa_pair_1693:
  - text: but i got lucky a few minutes later.
  utter_qa_pair_1694:
  - text: this is a huge library.
  utter_qa_pair_1695:
  - text: yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space.
  utter_qa_pair_1696:
  - text: and lots of books.
  utter_qa_pair_1697:
  - text: and lots of thieves.
  utter_qa_pair_1698:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1699:
  - text: i mean, keep your belongings close to you.
  utter_qa_pair_1700:
  - text: the only thing in my backpack is used books.
  utter_qa_pair_1701:
  - text: but thieves don't know that.
  utter_qa_pair_1702:
  - text: they might think that i've got an ipod or laptop in there.
  utter_qa_pair_1703:
  - text: now you're thinking.
  utter_qa_pair_1704:
  - text: you'd think a library would be safe from thieves.
  utter_qa_pair_1705:
  - text: how good is your math?
  utter_qa_pair_1706:
  - text: i can add two and two.
  utter_qa_pair_1707:
  - text: so you're not very good at math?
  utter_qa_pair_1708:
  - text: i'm terrible at math.
  utter_qa_pair_1709:
  - text: well, i need some help.
  utter_qa_pair_1710:
  - text: with what?
  utter_qa_pair_1711:
  - text: i'm taking a math course in school.
  utter_qa_pair_1712:
  - text: well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.
  utter_qa_pair_1713:
  - text: i can't do that.
  utter_qa_pair_1714:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_1715:
  - text: they might think i'm stupid.
  utter_qa_pair_1716:
  - text: do you believe in god?
  utter_qa_pair_1717:
  - text: of course.
  utter_qa_pair_1718:
  - text: do you pray to god?
  utter_qa_pair_1719:
  - text: occasionally.
  utter_qa_pair_1720:
  - text: when's that?
  utter_qa_pair_1721:
  - text: when i need something.
  utter_qa_pair_1722:
  - text: like what?
  utter_qa_pair_1723:
  - text: well, if i have a big test at school.
  utter_qa_pair_1724:
  - text: does god answer your prayers?
  utter_qa_pair_1725:
  - text: yes, i've passed all my tests.
  utter_qa_pair_1726:
  - text: do you ever pray for money?
  utter_qa_pair_1727:
  - text: the cops finally found the husband.
  utter_qa_pair_1728:
  - text: what husband?
  utter_qa_pair_1729:
  - text: the husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m.
  utter_qa_pair_1730:
  - text: oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.
  utter_qa_pair_1731:
  - text: the husband said he tried to help the boy.
  utter_qa_pair_1732:
  - text: yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car.
  utter_qa_pair_1733:
  - text: no, he said he gently placed the boy on the street.
  utter_qa_pair_1734:
  - text: so what? they still drove off.
  utter_qa_pair_1735:
  - text: the husband said a fire department was nearby.
  utter_qa_pair_1736:
  - text: so what? did he dial 911?
  utter_qa_pair_1737:
  - text: he said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it.
  utter_qa_pair_1738:
  - text: i don't like riding the bus.
  utter_qa_pair_1739:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_1740:
  - text: the seats and windows are dirty.
  utter_qa_pair_1741:
  - text: don't they clean the bus every night?
  utter_qa_pair_1742:
  - text: i think they do.
  utter_qa_pair_1743:
  - text: you should bring some wipes with you.
  utter_qa_pair_1744:
  - text: that's a good idea.
  utter_qa_pair_1745:
  - text: then you can wipe your seat and window.
  utter_qa_pair_1746:
  - text: people will think i'm strange.
  utter_qa_pair_1747:
  - text: who cares? everyone is strange.
  utter_qa_pair_1748:
  - text: that's for sure.
  utter_qa_pair_1749:
  - text: i don't like riding the bus.
  utter_qa_pair_1750:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_1751:
  - text: number one, it's too slow.
  utter_qa_pair_1752:
  - text: you're right. a car is faster.
  utter_qa_pair_1753:
  - text: number two, it's usually late.
  utter_qa_pair_1754:
  - text: you're right. the buses are never on time.
  utter_qa_pair_1755:
  - text: number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.
  utter_qa_pair_1756:
  - text: you're right. buses don't run late at night.
  utter_qa_pair_1757:
  - text: number four, it's too crowded.
  utter_qa_pair_1758:
  - text: you're right. you have to stand in the aisle.
  utter_qa_pair_1759:
  - text: number five, it's unsafe.
  utter_qa_pair_1760:
  - text: we had a problem at school.
  utter_qa_pair_1761:
  - text: what was the problem?
  utter_qa_pair_1762:
  - text: someone cut the tires.
  utter_qa_pair_1763:
  - text: what tires?
  utter_qa_pair_1764:
  - text: the tires on the cars.
  utter_qa_pair_1765:
  - text: where were the cars?
  utter_qa_pair_1766:
  - text: they were in the student parking lot.
  utter_qa_pair_1767:
  - text: how many tires were cut?
  utter_qa_pair_1768:
  - text: one or two tires were cut on each car.
  utter_qa_pair_1769:
  - text: how many cars?
  utter_qa_pair_1770:
  - text: eleven cars.
  utter_qa_pair_1771:
  - text: life isn't fair.
  utter_qa_pair_1772:
  - text: it sure isn't.
  utter_qa_pair_1773:
  - text: i got a ticket yesterday.
  utter_qa_pair_1774:
  - text: what for?
  utter_qa_pair_1775:
  - text: i was crossing the street.
  utter_qa_pair_1776:
  - text: were you in a crosswalk?
  utter_qa_pair_1777:
  - text: yes, but the red hand was blinking.
  utter_qa_pair_1778:
  - text: so? that's a ticket?
  utter_qa_pair_1779:
  - text: yes, it's a $140 ticket.
  utter_qa_pair_1780:
  - text: that's not right!
  utter_qa_pair_1781:
  - text: when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
  utter_qa_pair_1782:
  - text: you're driving too fast.
  utter_qa_pair_1783:
  - text: why do you say that?
  utter_qa_pair_1784:
  - text: the speed limit is 65.
  utter_qa_pair_1785:
  - text: i know that.
  utter_qa_pair_1786:
  - text: but you're doing 75.
  utter_qa_pair_1787:
  - text: so is everyone else.
  utter_qa_pair_1788:
  - text: but a cop might stop you.
  utter_qa_pair_1789:
  - text: no, he won't. some cars are doing 85.
  utter_qa_pair_1790:
  - text: so the cop will stop those cars?
  utter_qa_pair_1791:
  - text: of course. he stops the fastest cars.
  utter_qa_pair_1792:
  - text: my friend got a ticket for doing 75.
  utter_qa_pair_1793:
  - text: remember to put air in your tires.
  utter_qa_pair_1794:
  - text: how often do i have to do that?
  utter_qa_pair_1795:
  - text: once every two months.
  utter_qa_pair_1796:
  - text: that's a lot.
  utter_qa_pair_1797:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1798:
  - text: that's six times a year!
  utter_qa_pair_1799:
  - text: yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.
  utter_qa_pair_1800:
  - text: i'll try.
  utter_qa_pair_1801:
  - text: check your tires or you'll get a flat.
  utter_qa_pair_1802:
  - text: oh. that's not good.
  utter_qa_pair_1803:
  - text: no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money.
  utter_qa_pair_1804:
  - text: you're driving too fast.
  utter_qa_pair_1805:
  - text: i'm in a hurry.
  utter_qa_pair_1806:
  - text: don't ever be in a hurry.
  utter_qa_pair_1807:
  - text: it's not my fault. you didn't wake me up.
  utter_qa_pair_1808:
  - text: that's not my fault. you didn't tell me to wake you up.
  utter_qa_pair_1809:
  - text: well, i meant to.
  utter_qa_pair_1810:
  - text: don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
  utter_qa_pair_1811:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_1812:
  - text: because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in
      a hurry.
  utter_qa_pair_1813:
  - text: how do you know that?
  utter_qa_pair_1814:
  - text: i read a lot.
  utter_qa_pair_1815:
  - text: let's go for a ride.
  utter_qa_pair_1816:
  - text: where are we going?
  utter_qa_pair_1817:
  - text: into the mountains.
  utter_qa_pair_1818:
  - text: that sounds nice.
  utter_qa_pair_1819:
  - text: i want to show you my new car.
  utter_qa_pair_1820:
  - text: you bought a new car?
  utter_qa_pair_1821:
  - text: yes. i bought a cadillac.
  utter_qa_pair_1822:
  - text: a luxury car.
  utter_qa_pair_1823:
  - text: luxury plus speed.
  utter_qa_pair_1824:
  - text: what are we waiting for?
  utter_qa_pair_1825:
  - text: let me get the keys.
  utter_qa_pair_1826:
  - text: i have to go to the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_1827:
  - text: why didn't you go before we left?
  utter_qa_pair_1828:
  - text: i did, but i have to go again.
  utter_qa_pair_1829:
  - text: well, hold on a little longer.
  utter_qa_pair_1830:
  - text: i think i'm going to explode.
  utter_qa_pair_1831:
  - text: just hold on.
  utter_qa_pair_1832:
  - text: oh! don't hit any more bumps!
  utter_qa_pair_1833:
  - text: we'll be at mcdonald's in just a few minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_1834:
  - text: i hope they are fast minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_1835:
  - text: think about something else. think about a hamburger.
  utter_qa_pair_1836:
  - text: i'm thinking, but i still have to go.
  utter_qa_pair_1837:
  - text: where's the car?
  utter_qa_pair_1838:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1839:
  - text: the car isn't here.
  utter_qa_pair_1840:
  - text: where did you park it?
  utter_qa_pair_1841:
  - text: i parked it right here.
  utter_qa_pair_1842:
  - text: are you sure?
  utter_qa_pair_1843:
  - text: yes. i remember this big tree.
  utter_qa_pair_1844:
  - text: maybe it's the wrong tree.
  utter_qa_pair_1845:
  - text: no, this is the tree.
  utter_qa_pair_1846:
  - text: did someone steal it?
  utter_qa_pair_1847:
  - text: i sure hope not.
  utter_qa_pair_1848:
  - text: look at this traffic.
  utter_qa_pair_1849:
  - text: i'd rather not.
  utter_qa_pair_1850:
  - text: it gets worse every year.
  utter_qa_pair_1851:
  - text: why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.
  utter_qa_pair_1852:
  - text: the speed limit is 65!
  utter_qa_pair_1853:
  - text: well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
  utter_qa_pair_1854:
  - text: where are all these people going?
  utter_qa_pair_1855:
  - text: they're all asking the same question.
  utter_qa_pair_1856:
  - text: when are they going to fix this problem?
  utter_qa_pair_1857:
  - text: they said they need more money.
  utter_qa_pair_1858:
  - text: they always need more money.
  utter_qa_pair_1859:
  - text: did you see that car?
  utter_qa_pair_1860:
  - text: yes, he went through the red light.
  utter_qa_pair_1861:
  - text: can we call the police?
  utter_qa_pair_1862:
  - text: no, the police don't care.
  utter_qa_pair_1863:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_1864:
  - text: they have to see it happen.
  utter_qa_pair_1865:
  - text: they don't believe us?
  utter_qa_pair_1866:
  - text: no. they can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
  utter_qa_pair_1867:
  - text: so, what do we do?
  utter_qa_pair_1868:
  - text: we don't do anything.
  utter_qa_pair_1869:
  - text: maybe we should honk the horn next time.
  utter_qa_pair_1870:
  - text: my car is dirty.
  utter_qa_pair_1871:
  - text: why don't you wash it?
  utter_qa_pair_1872:
  - text: that's what i'm going to do.
  utter_qa_pair_1873:
  - text: are you going to wash it yourself?
  utter_qa_pair_1874:
  - text: of course. it's not a hard job.
  utter_qa_pair_1875:
  - text: i'll help you.
  utter_qa_pair_1876:
  - text: okay, i'll get a bucket.
  utter_qa_pair_1877:
  - text: i'll rinse the car first.
  utter_qa_pair_1878:
  - text: then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
  utter_qa_pair_1879:
  - text: after that, we can dry it with a towel.
  utter_qa_pair_1880:
  - text: then it will look like new
  utter_qa_pair_1881:
  - text: it sure is windy today.
  utter_qa_pair_1882:
  - text: paper is flying everywhere.
  utter_qa_pair_1883:
  - text: this wind is dangerous for drivers.
  utter_qa_pair_1884:
  - text: especially for drivers of big trucks.
  utter_qa_pair_1885:
  - text: the wind blows those trucks over.
  utter_qa_pair_1886:
  - text: it blows trees over, too.
  utter_qa_pair_1887:
  - text: a tree fell onto my dad's car.
  utter_qa_pair_1888:
  - text: was there much damage?
  utter_qa_pair_1889:
  - text: my dad had to buy a new car.
  utter_qa_pair_1890:
  - text: wow! that's terrible.
  utter_qa_pair_1891:
  - text: never park your car under a tree.
  utter_qa_pair_1892:
  - text: when are we going to stop?
  utter_qa_pair_1893:
  - text: we'll stop at the next mcdonald's.
  utter_qa_pair_1894:
  - text: how far away is that?
  utter_qa_pair_1895:
  - text: i think we'll be there in half an hour.
  utter_qa_pair_1896:
  - text: i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_1897:
  - text: well, i can always pull over.
  utter_qa_pair_1898:
  - text: no, thank you, i'll just wait.
  utter_qa_pair_1899:
  - text: we can kill two birds with one stone.
  utter_qa_pair_1900:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1901:
  - text: while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food.
  utter_qa_pair_1902:
  - text: don't order for me. i'm not hungry.
  utter_qa_pair_1903:
  - text: this is such a long light.
  utter_qa_pair_1904:
  - text: look how many cars are waiting in line.
  utter_qa_pair_1905:
  - text: they need a left-turn arrow.
  utter_qa_pair_1906:
  - text: only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_1907:
  - text: we'll be here forever.
  utter_qa_pair_1908:
  - text: get out of this lane.
  utter_qa_pair_1909:
  - text: but we need to turn left.
  utter_qa_pair_1910:
  - text: forget it. go straight.
  utter_qa_pair_1911:
  - text: then what?
  utter_qa_pair_1912:
  - text: then we'll just make a u-turn.
  utter_qa_pair_1913:
  - text: and then we can turn right at the light.
  utter_qa_pair_1914:
  - text: i need a cheap car.
  utter_qa_pair_1915:
  - text: how much money do you have?
  utter_qa_pair_1916:
  - text: $1,000.
  utter_qa_pair_1917:
  - text: well, that should get you something.
  utter_qa_pair_1918:
  - text: but i need something that's reliable.
  utter_qa_pair_1919:
  - text: you need a car with low mileage.
  utter_qa_pair_1920:
  - text: a car that was owned by a little old lady.
  utter_qa_pair_1921:
  - text: where have you looked?
  utter_qa_pair_1922:
  - text: i haven't looked anywhere yet.
  utter_qa_pair_1923:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_1924:
  - text: because i'll never find one for such a low price.
  utter_qa_pair_1925:
  - text: good afternoon, officer.
  utter_qa_pair_1926:
  - text: your driver's license and registration, please.
  utter_qa_pair_1927:
  - text: here you go.
  utter_qa_pair_1928:
  - text: do you know why i pulled you over?
  utter_qa_pair_1929:
  - text: i have no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren.
  utter_qa_pair_1930:
  - text: you rolled through that stop sign back there.
  utter_qa_pair_1931:
  - text: but i stopped!
  utter_qa_pair_1932:
  - text: no, you didn't. you slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.
  utter_qa_pair_1933:
  - text: well, nobody else does, so why should i?
  utter_qa_pair_1934:
  - text: that's not the attitude of a good driver.
  utter_qa_pair_1935:
  - text: but i am a good driver. i've never had a ticket in my life.
  utter_qa_pair_1936:
  - text: $140. i can't believe it.
  utter_qa_pair_1937:
  - text: what are you talking about?
  utter_qa_pair_1938:
  - text: i got a ticket downtown for $140.
  utter_qa_pair_1939:
  - text: were you speeding?
  utter_qa_pair_1940:
  - text: no, i was crossing the street.
  utter_qa_pair_1941:
  - text: were you jaywalking?
  utter_qa_pair_1942:
  - text: no, i was in the crosswalk.
  utter_qa_pair_1943:
  - text: so why did you get a ticket?
  utter_qa_pair_1944:
  - text: the officer said the red hand was blinking.
  utter_qa_pair_1945:
  - text: was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
  utter_qa_pair_1946:
  - text: no, the white walk sign was blinking.
  utter_qa_pair_1947:
  - text: they were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
  utter_qa_pair_1948:
  - text: who?
  utter_qa_pair_1949:
  - text: two students from usc.
  utter_qa_pair_1950:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_1951:
  - text: a speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.
  utter_qa_pair_1952:
  - text: what happened to the other student?
  utter_qa_pair_1953:
  - text: he landed on the hood of the car.
  utter_qa_pair_1954:
  - text: did he get off the hood?
  utter_qa_pair_1955:
  - text: no, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the
      hood.
  utter_qa_pair_1956:
  - text: i'll bet the car continued on its way.
  utter_qa_pair_1957:
  - text: of course it did. why stop after you've run over two people?
  utter_qa_pair_1958:
  - text: what happened to your car?
  utter_qa_pair_1959:
  - text: i got a dent in the parking lot.
  utter_qa_pair_1960:
  - text: how did you get it?
  utter_qa_pair_1961:
  - text: i don't know. maybe it was from a shopping cart.
  utter_qa_pair_1962:
  - text: those shopping carts are dangerous.
  utter_qa_pair_1963:
  - text: especially the metal ones.
  utter_qa_pair_1964:
  - text: i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
  utter_qa_pair_1965:
  - text: that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.
  utter_qa_pair_1966:
  - text: did you save any money on the sale?
  utter_qa_pair_1967:
  - text: yes, i did. i saved about $50.
  utter_qa_pair_1968:
  - text: that's great.
  utter_qa_pair_1969:
  - text: did you see "titanic"?
  utter_qa_pair_1970:
  - text: yes. it is a great movie.
  utter_qa_pair_1971:
  - text: i saw it twelve times.
  utter_qa_pair_1972:
  - text: i saw it eight times.
  utter_qa_pair_1973:
  - text: i have the dvd.
  utter_qa_pair_1974:
  - text: so do i.
  utter_qa_pair_1975:
  - text: let's go to your home.
  utter_qa_pair_1976:
  - text: we can watch my dvd.
  utter_qa_pair_1977:
  - text: and then we can go to my home.
  utter_qa_pair_1978:
  - text: and watch your dvd.
  utter_qa_pair_1979:
  - text: i always cry at the end.
  utter_qa_pair_1980:
  - text: let's play cards.
  utter_qa_pair_1981:
  - text: i don't know any card games.
  utter_qa_pair_1982:
  - text: i'll teach you one.
  utter_qa_pair_1983:
  - text: okay. what will you teach me?
  utter_qa_pair_1984:
  - text: it's called poker.
  utter_qa_pair_1985:
  - text: is it easy to learn?
  utter_qa_pair_1986:
  - text: yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_1987:
  - text: okay. teach me how to play.
  utter_qa_pair_1988:
  - text: we each get five cards.
  utter_qa_pair_1989:
  - text: oh, look. i have four tens.
  utter_qa_pair_1990:
  - text: that's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
  utter_qa_pair_1991:
  - text: i'm a good card player.
  utter_qa_pair_1992:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_1993:
  - text: because i watch the other players.
  utter_qa_pair_1994:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_1995:
  - text: people will tell you if they have a good hand.
  utter_qa_pair_1996:
  - text: how do they do that?
  utter_qa_pair_1997:
  - text: for example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
  utter_qa_pair_1998:
  - text: when he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
  utter_qa_pair_1999:
  - text: i know he has a good hand, so i don't bet.
  utter_qa_pair_2000:
  - text: he never wins your money?
  utter_qa_pair_2001:
  - text: nope, and it drives him crazy.
  utter_qa_pair_2002:
  - text: turn the radio down, please.
  utter_qa_pair_2003:
  - text: but i'm listening to it.
  utter_qa_pair_2004:
  - text: well, listen to it more quietly.
  utter_qa_pair_2005:
  - text: i can't wait till i grow up.
  utter_qa_pair_2006:
  - text: what will you do?
  utter_qa_pair_2007:
  - text: i will play the radio as loud as i want.
  utter_qa_pair_2008:
  - text: that's okay with me.
  utter_qa_pair_2009:
  - text: i will have a radio in every room of my house.
  utter_qa_pair_2010:
  - text: remind me to never visit you.
  utter_qa_pair_2011:
  - text: all the radios will be on extra loud.
  utter_qa_pair_2012:
  - text: your neighbors will hate you.
  utter_qa_pair_2013:
  - text: i hope i win the lotto.
  utter_qa_pair_2014:
  - text: your chances are very small.
  utter_qa_pair_2015:
  - text: but you can't win if you don't play.
  utter_qa_pair_2016:
  - text: ha! you can't win if you do play.
  utter_qa_pair_2017:
  - text: someone has to win.
  utter_qa_pair_2018:
  - text: that's what everyone says.
  utter_qa_pair_2019:
  - text: it might as well be me.
  utter_qa_pair_2020:
  - text: that's what everyone says.
  utter_qa_pair_2021:
  - text: you're trying to tell me something.
  utter_qa_pair_2022:
  - text: that didn't take long.
  utter_qa_pair_2023:
  - text: you think i should quit playing.
  utter_qa_pair_2024:
  - text: what's on tv?
  utter_qa_pair_2025:
  - text: nothing much.
  utter_qa_pair_2026:
  - text: what about the baseball game?
  utter_qa_pair_2027:
  - text: it got rained out.
  utter_qa_pair_2028:
  - text: rained out?
  utter_qa_pair_2029:
  - text: yes, rained out.
  utter_qa_pair_2030:
  - text: how could that be?
  utter_qa_pair_2031:
  - text: well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
  utter_qa_pair_2032:
  - text: i thought they were playing under a dome.
  utter_qa_pair_2033:
  - text: the dome doesn't close.
  utter_qa_pair_2034:
  - text: why doesn't it close?
  utter_qa_pair_2035:
  - text: can i try your coffee?
  utter_qa_pair_2036:
  - text: sure. here you go.
  utter_qa_pair_2037:
  - text: hmm, that's not bad.
  utter_qa_pair_2038:
  - text: there's nothing in it.
  utter_qa_pair_2039:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2040:
  - text: i mean, it's just coffee.
  utter_qa_pair_2041:
  - text: i figured that.
  utter_qa_pair_2042:
  - text: it's not too bitter for you?
  utter_qa_pair_2043:
  - text: it's a little bitter, but it's okay.
  utter_qa_pair_2044:
  - text: there's no sugar or cream in it.
  utter_qa_pair_2045:
  - text: no, it's a taste you have to get used to.
  utter_qa_pair_2046:
  - text: let's take a walk.
  utter_qa_pair_2047:
  - text: what's the weather like?
  utter_qa_pair_2048:
  - text: let me step outside and see.
  utter_qa_pair_2049:
  - text: it's a little chilly, right?
  utter_qa_pair_2050:
  - text: yes, it is.
  utter_qa_pair_2051:
  - text: i'll put on my cap.
  utter_qa_pair_2052:
  - text: wear a jacket, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2053:
  - text: i wonder if i should bring my gloves.
  utter_qa_pair_2054:
  - text: maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
  utter_qa_pair_2055:
  - text: i'll put a glove in each pocket.
  utter_qa_pair_2056:
  - text: we'll get warmer as we walk.
  utter_qa_pair_2057:
  - text: look at the car chase on tv!
  utter_qa_pair_2058:
  - text: that driver is crazy.
  utter_qa_pair_2059:
  - text: i can't believe he hasn't crashed.
  utter_qa_pair_2060:
  - text: how fast is he going?
  utter_qa_pair_2061:
  - text: they say he's going 80 miles per hour.
  utter_qa_pair_2062:
  - text: he's going to kill someone.
  utter_qa_pair_2063:
  - text: look! he just hit that car.
  utter_qa_pair_2064:
  - text: oh, my goodness. no one is safe on the streets.
  utter_qa_pair_2065:
  - text: now he's slowing down.
  utter_qa_pair_2066:
  - text: maybe he ran out of gas.
  utter_qa_pair_2067:
  - text: look! he just got out of the car and started running.
  utter_qa_pair_2068:
  - text: tv news is so stupid.
  utter_qa_pair_2069:
  - text: they shouldn't even call it news.
  utter_qa_pair_2070:
  - text: last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
  utter_qa_pair_2071:
  - text: yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
  utter_qa_pair_2072:
  - text: last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
  utter_qa_pair_2073:
  - text: last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2074:
  - text: the weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
  utter_qa_pair_2075:
  - text: the sports guy shows us players fighting.
  utter_qa_pair_2076:
  - text: they always tell us "what's next."
  utter_qa_pair_2077:
  - text: they always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.
  utter_qa_pair_2078:
  - text: it's more like news for kids.
  utter_qa_pair_2079:
  - text: i love my computer.
  utter_qa_pair_2080:
  - text: computers are so cool.
  utter_qa_pair_2081:
  - text: i love to go online.
  utter_qa_pair_2082:
  - text: the internet is amazing.
  utter_qa_pair_2083:
  - text: you can travel all over the world.
  utter_qa_pair_2084:
  - text: i know. i went to china yesterday.
  utter_qa_pair_2085:
  - text: what did you do?
  utter_qa_pair_2086:
  - text: i stood on the great wall and looked all around.
  utter_qa_pair_2087:
  - text: what was it like?
  utter_qa_pair_2088:
  - text: it was like the real thing.
  utter_qa_pair_2089:
  - text: it was like being there?
  utter_qa_pair_2090:
  - text: the beatles are the best.
  utter_qa_pair_2091:
  - text: they are the best musical group ever.
  utter_qa_pair_2092:
  - text: i love all their songs.
  utter_qa_pair_2093:
  - text: i don't know which one i like the best.
  utter_qa_pair_2094:
  - text: i like the ones i can sing along with.
  utter_qa_pair_2095:
  - text: so do i, like "she loves you."
  utter_qa_pair_2096:
  - text: '"she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah!..."'
  utter_qa_pair_2097:
  - text: '"Â…and you know you should be glad!"'
  utter_qa_pair_2098:
  - text: what a great song.
  utter_qa_pair_2099:
  - text: how about "let it be?"
  utter_qa_pair_2100:
  - text: oh, yes! "let it be, let it beÂ…"
  utter_qa_pair_2101:
  - text: let's go to a movie.
  utter_qa_pair_2102:
  - text: i'd rather not.
  utter_qa_pair_2103:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_2104:
  - text: you know i don't like crowds.
  utter_qa_pair_2105:
  - text: let's go to an early movie.
  utter_qa_pair_2106:
  - text: okay, that won't be very crowded.
  utter_qa_pair_2107:
  - text: what would you like to see?
  utter_qa_pair_2108:
  - text: oh, i don't care. you're the one who wants to go out.
  utter_qa_pair_2109:
  - text: well, i want to see "the pursuit of happyness."
  utter_qa_pair_2110:
  - text: what have you heard about it?
  utter_qa_pair_2111:
  - text: it's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
  utter_qa_pair_2112:
  - text: what's your favorite thing to do?
  utter_qa_pair_2113:
  - text: i like to watch people.
  utter_qa_pair_2114:
  - text: that's your favorite thing to do?
  utter_qa_pair_2115:
  - text: well, it's one of them.
  utter_qa_pair_2116:
  - text: where do you go to watch people?
  utter_qa_pair_2117:
  - text: my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks.
  utter_qa_pair_2118:
  - text: that sounds like a good spot.
  utter_qa_pair_2119:
  - text: we watch people walk by with their dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_2120:
  - text: i guess you see lots of different dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_2121:
  - text: we don't even know what kind most of them are.
  utter_qa_pair_2122:
  - text: there are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
  utter_qa_pair_2123:
  - text: they call him father dollar bill.
  utter_qa_pair_2124:
  - text: yes, he was on the tv news today.
  utter_qa_pair_2125:
  - text: every easter sunday he gives away money.
  utter_qa_pair_2126:
  - text: is it his money?
  utter_qa_pair_2127:
  - text: no. movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
  utter_qa_pair_2128:
  - text: how much money does he give away?
  utter_qa_pair_2129:
  - text: this year he gave away $15,000.
  utter_qa_pair_2130:
  - text: that's a lot of money.
  utter_qa_pair_2131:
  - text: he gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
  utter_qa_pair_2132:
  - text: what about the other homeless people?
  utter_qa_pair_2133:
  - text: they got $1 each.
  utter_qa_pair_2134:
  - text: old movies are the best.
  utter_qa_pair_2135:
  - text: even though they're in black and white.
  utter_qa_pair_2136:
  - text: a good story is more important than color.
  utter_qa_pair_2137:
  - text: actors didn't curse back then.
  utter_qa_pair_2138:
  - text: and there was no violence.
  utter_qa_pair_2139:
  - text: people today don't like that.
  utter_qa_pair_2140:
  - text: no, today people like lots of action.
  utter_qa_pair_2141:
  - text: i like a good story.
  utter_qa_pair_2142:
  - text: i like to see actors who are like real people.
  utter_qa_pair_2143:
  - text: like real people with real problems.
  utter_qa_pair_2144:
  - text: they still make movies like that.
  utter_qa_pair_2145:
  - text: do you get pbs on tv?
  utter_qa_pair_2146:
  - text: yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system.
  utter_qa_pair_2147:
  - text: it puts me to sleep.
  utter_qa_pair_2148:
  - text: tell me about it.
  utter_qa_pair_2149:
  - text: a gardening show follows a knitting show.
  utter_qa_pair_2150:
  - text: a cooking show follows a sewing show.
  utter_qa_pair_2151:
  - text: a travel show follows another travel show.
  utter_qa_pair_2152:
  - text: i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already!
  utter_qa_pair_2153:
  - text: now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies.
  utter_qa_pair_2154:
  - text: i sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
  utter_qa_pair_2155:
  - text: if more people donate money, pbs could offer new shows.
  utter_qa_pair_2156:
  - text: i love to watch "judge judy."
  utter_qa_pair_2157:
  - text: is that a tv show?
  utter_qa_pair_2158:
  - text: yes. it's on every afternoon.
  utter_qa_pair_2159:
  - text: what's so good about it?
  utter_qa_pair_2160:
  - text: they have interesting lawsuits.
  utter_qa_pair_2161:
  - text: such as?
  utter_qa_pair_2162:
  - text: yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on ebay.
  utter_qa_pair_2163:
  - text: was something wrong with the phone?
  utter_qa_pair_2164:
  - text: it works only in canada.
  utter_qa_pair_2165:
  - text: did the seller know that?
  utter_qa_pair_2166:
  - text: yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.
  utter_qa_pair_2167:
  - text: that woman is a very good singer.
  utter_qa_pair_2168:
  - text: yes, but she looks like a man.
  utter_qa_pair_2169:
  - text: what difference does it make?
  utter_qa_pair_2170:
  - text: female singers are supposed to be pretty.
  utter_qa_pair_2171:
  - text: singers are supposed to sound good.
  utter_qa_pair_2172:
  - text: they should look good, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2173:
  - text: there are lots of ugly men singers.
  utter_qa_pair_2174:
  - text: men singers don't have to look good.
  utter_qa_pair_2175:
  - text: then neither do women singers.
  utter_qa_pair_2176:
  - text: well, i would never buy her cd.
  utter_qa_pair_2177:
  - text: but you would buy her cd if she was pretty?
  utter_qa_pair_2178:
  - text: all the tv stations are going to go digital.
  utter_qa_pair_2179:
  - text: yes, that will occur next month.
  utter_qa_pair_2180:
  - text: most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
  utter_qa_pair_2181:
  - text: the digital signal is very clear.
  utter_qa_pair_2182:
  - text: oh, no, it isn't!
  utter_qa_pair_2183:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2184:
  - text: i can't get a single channel.
  utter_qa_pair_2185:
  - text: do you have a digital tv?
  utter_qa_pair_2186:
  - text: of course. but i don't have cable.
  utter_qa_pair_2187:
  - text: you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.
  utter_qa_pair_2188:
  - text: but i have rabbit ears.
  utter_qa_pair_2189:
  - text: i've got a date for you.
  utter_qa_pair_2190:
  - text: oh, really?
  utter_qa_pair_2191:
  - text: are you interested?
  utter_qa_pair_2192:
  - text: maybe. what is she like?
  utter_qa_pair_2193:
  - text: she's got a great personality.
  utter_qa_pair_2194:
  - text: uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.
  utter_qa_pair_2195:
  - text: she's cute.
  utter_qa_pair_2196:
  - text: okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
  utter_qa_pair_2197:
  - text: she weighs 98 pounds.
  utter_qa_pair_2198:
  - text: okay, she's not fat. so what's the problem with her?
  utter_qa_pair_2199:
  - text: who said there is a problem with her?
  utter_qa_pair_2200:
  - text: i think you're very pretty.
  utter_qa_pair_2201:
  - text: thank you.
  utter_qa_pair_2202:
  - text: would you have dinner with me?
  utter_qa_pair_2203:
  - text: i would like to.
  utter_qa_pair_2204:
  - text: can i pick you up friday night?
  utter_qa_pair_2205:
  - text: what time?
  utter_qa_pair_2206:
  - text: eight o'clock.
  utter_qa_pair_2207:
  - text: that sounds great.
  utter_qa_pair_2208:
  - text: we'll go to a french restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2209:
  - text: i've never been to a french restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2210:
  - text: i think you'll love the food.
  utter_qa_pair_2211:
  - text: you have pretty eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_2212:
  - text: thank you. so do you.
  utter_qa_pair_2213:
  - text: i wish my eyes were blue.
  utter_qa_pair_2214:
  - text: what's the matter with green eyes?
  utter_qa_pair_2215:
  - text: nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
  utter_qa_pair_2216:
  - text: maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_2217:
  - text: but what if i'm a fish in my next life?
  utter_qa_pair_2218:
  - text: i think some fish have blue eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_2219:
  - text: i hope i don't come back as a fish.
  utter_qa_pair_2220:
  - text: i hope i come back as a cat.
  utter_qa_pair_2221:
  - text: cats have beautiful eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_2222:
  - text: i love you.
  utter_qa_pair_2223:
  - text: i love you, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2224:
  - text: i loved you the first day i saw you.
  utter_qa_pair_2225:
  - text: it was love at first sight?
  utter_qa_pair_2226:
  - text: yes, it was love at first sight.
  utter_qa_pair_2227:
  - text: i didn't love you at first.
  utter_qa_pair_2228:
  - text: i know. i had to chase you for a while.
  utter_qa_pair_2229:
  - text: yes, you chased me and then you caught me.
  utter_qa_pair_2230:
  - text: now you're mine forever.
  utter_qa_pair_2231:
  - text: and you're mine forever.
  utter_qa_pair_2232:
  - text: we'll grow old together.
  utter_qa_pair_2233:
  - text: i'm in love with that girl.
  utter_qa_pair_2234:
  - text: have you told her?
  utter_qa_pair_2235:
  - text: of course not.
  utter_qa_pair_2236:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_2237:
  - text: she would laugh at me.
  utter_qa_pair_2238:
  - text: how do you know?
  utter_qa_pair_2239:
  - text: because they always do.
  utter_qa_pair_2240:
  - text: maybe she's different.
  utter_qa_pair_2241:
  - text: they're all the same.
  utter_qa_pair_2242:
  - text: just ask her out to dinner.
  utter_qa_pair_2243:
  - text: and then what?
  utter_qa_pair_2244:
  - text: give me a hug.
  utter_qa_pair_2245:
  - text: i'm not in the mood.
  utter_qa_pair_2246:
  - text: what's the matter?
  utter_qa_pair_2247:
  - text: i saw you looking at that woman.
  utter_qa_pair_2248:
  - text: what woman?
  utter_qa_pair_2249:
  - text: you know, that woman with the big boobs.
  utter_qa_pair_2250:
  - text: i was not looking at her.
  utter_qa_pair_2251:
  - text: you were, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2252:
  - text: i'm not interested in her.
  utter_qa_pair_2253:
  - text: then why were you looking at her?
  utter_qa_pair_2254:
  - text: i was looking at something else.
  utter_qa_pair_2255:
  - text: would you like to go on a blind date?
  utter_qa_pair_2256:
  - text: you must be joking.
  utter_qa_pair_2257:
  - text: no, i'm serious.
  utter_qa_pair_2258:
  - text: i don't want to date a blind woman.
  utter_qa_pair_2259:
  - text: a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
  utter_qa_pair_2260:
  - text: what does it mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2261:
  - text: a blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
  utter_qa_pair_2262:
  - text: why would i date someone i don't even know?
  utter_qa_pair_2263:
  - text: to try something new and exciting.
  utter_qa_pair_2264:
  - text: what if i don't like her?
  utter_qa_pair_2265:
  - text: i have a date tomorrow night.
  utter_qa_pair_2266:
  - text: really? who with?
  utter_qa_pair_2267:
  - text: a girl i met at the market.
  utter_qa_pair_2268:
  - text: you met a girl at the supermarket?
  utter_qa_pair_2269:
  - text: she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
  utter_qa_pair_2270:
  - text: what did you say to her?
  utter_qa_pair_2271:
  - text: i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them.
  utter_qa_pair_2272:
  - text: she asked you about your pineapples?
  utter_qa_pair_2273:
  - text: i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one
      of mine.
  utter_qa_pair_2274:
  - text: that was nice of you.
  utter_qa_pair_2275:
  - text: she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out.
  utter_qa_pair_2276:
  - text: did you have a date friday night?
  utter_qa_pair_2277:
  - text: yes, in fact, i did.
  utter_qa_pair_2278:
  - text: who did you go out with?
  utter_qa_pair_2279:
  - text: a man i met in a coffee shop.
  utter_qa_pair_2280:
  - text: where did you go?
  utter_qa_pair_2281:
  - text: we went to a nice restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2282:
  - text: anywhere else?
  utter_qa_pair_2283:
  - text: then we went to a jazz club.
  utter_qa_pair_2284:
  - text: that sounds like a nice date.
  utter_qa_pair_2285:
  - text: yes, it was pleasant.
  utter_qa_pair_2286:
  - text: but you won't date him again?
  utter_qa_pair_2287:
  - text: i had the worst date the other night.
  utter_qa_pair_2288:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_2289:
  - text: first of all, he was half an hour late.
  utter_qa_pair_2290:
  - text: that's not a good start.
  utter_qa_pair_2291:
  - text: then he didn't bother to apologize.
  utter_qa_pair_2292:
  - text: that's rude.
  utter_qa_pair_2293:
  - text: then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2294:
  - text: that's dangerous.
  utter_qa_pair_2295:
  - text: i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
  utter_qa_pair_2296:
  - text: what happened at the restaurant?
  utter_qa_pair_2297:
  - text: we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
  utter_qa_pair_2298:
  - text: i don't like that man.
  utter_qa_pair_2299:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_2300:
  - text: he's a dirty old man.
  utter_qa_pair_2301:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2302:
  - text: he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
  utter_qa_pair_2303:
  - text: well, you can't blame a man for asking.
  utter_qa_pair_2304:
  - text: he should act his age.
  utter_qa_pair_2305:
  - text: but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
  utter_qa_pair_2306:
  - text: they should find a nice hobby.
  utter_qa_pair_2307:
  - text: just wait until you're 50 years old.
  utter_qa_pair_2308:
  - text: dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
  utter_qa_pair_2309:
  - text: does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
  utter_qa_pair_2310:
  - text: sometimes.
  utter_qa_pair_2311:
  - text: what does she do?
  utter_qa_pair_2312:
  - text: just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the
      world.
  utter_qa_pair_2313:
  - text: that was a nice thing to say.
  utter_qa_pair_2314:
  - text: that's what i thought.
  utter_qa_pair_2315:
  - text: what did she say?
  utter_qa_pair_2316:
  - text: she laughed! she didn't believe me.
  utter_qa_pair_2317:
  - text: that wasn't very nice of her.
  utter_qa_pair_2318:
  - text: she said that nothing is more important to me than money.
  utter_qa_pair_2319:
  - text: what did you say?
  utter_qa_pair_2320:
  - text: some people have good noses.
  utter_qa_pair_2321:
  - text: i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.
  utter_qa_pair_2322:
  - text: i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.
  utter_qa_pair_2323:
  - text: oh. but that can be a curse.
  utter_qa_pair_2324:
  - text: yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
  utter_qa_pair_2325:
  - text: i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
  utter_qa_pair_2326:
  - text: did she catch you using drugs?
  utter_qa_pair_2327:
  - text: sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.
  utter_qa_pair_2328:
  - text: you don't need a good nose for thatÂ—cigarettes stink.
  utter_qa_pair_2329:
  - text: but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that
      evening!
  utter_qa_pair_2330:
  - text: boy, that is a good nose.
  utter_qa_pair_2331:
  - text: let's go out to eat.
  utter_qa_pair_2332:
  - text: that sounds like fun.
  utter_qa_pair_2333:
  - text: where do you want to go?
  utter_qa_pair_2334:
  - text: let me think a minute.
  utter_qa_pair_2335:
  - text: i feel like chinese.
  utter_qa_pair_2336:
  - text: that sounds delicious.
  utter_qa_pair_2337:
  - text: i know a good chinese restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2338:
  - text: how far away is it?
  utter_qa_pair_2339:
  - text: it's only 10 minutes from here.
  utter_qa_pair_2340:
  - text: do we need reservations?
  utter_qa_pair_2341:
  - text: oh, no. we can walk right in.
  utter_qa_pair_2342:
  - text: i can't believe how long this line is.
  utter_qa_pair_2343:
  - text: this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?
  utter_qa_pair_2344:
  - text: yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?
  utter_qa_pair_2345:
  - text: it's the slowest hamburger in town.
  utter_qa_pair_2346:
  - text: that's because they cook it while you wait.
  utter_qa_pair_2347:
  - text: yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
  utter_qa_pair_2348:
  - text: a great burger and great service.
  utter_qa_pair_2349:
  - text: yes, the workers are very polite.
  utter_qa_pair_2350:
  - text: and they're clean.
  utter_qa_pair_2351:
  - text: i've been coming here for years.
  utter_qa_pair_2352:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_2353:
  - text: lunch was delicious.
  utter_qa_pair_2354:
  - text: thank you.
  utter_qa_pair_2355:
  - text: what kind of soup was that?
  utter_qa_pair_2356:
  - text: it was tomato soup.
  utter_qa_pair_2357:
  - text: that tasted so good.
  utter_qa_pair_2358:
  - text: i put lemon and butter in it.
  utter_qa_pair_2359:
  - text: the sandwich was good, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2360:
  - text: everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
  utter_qa_pair_2361:
  - text: especially on toast.
  utter_qa_pair_2362:
  - text: and the pickles were great, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2363:
  - text: tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
  utter_qa_pair_2364:
  - text: i'm calling the waiter.
  utter_qa_pair_2365:
  - text: what's the matter?
  utter_qa_pair_2366:
  - text: this steak has too much fat.
  utter_qa_pair_2367:
  - text: what do you want the waiter to do?
  utter_qa_pair_2368:
  - text: bring me a better steak.
  utter_qa_pair_2369:
  - text: i wouldn't do that.
  utter_qa_pair_2370:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_2371:
  - text: they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on
      it.
  utter_qa_pair_2372:
  - text: you're crazy.
  utter_qa_pair_2373:
  - text: then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
  utter_qa_pair_2374:
  - text: where do you get these crazy ideas?
  utter_qa_pair_2375:
  - text: let's leave.
  utter_qa_pair_2376:
  - text: but we just got here.
  utter_qa_pair_2377:
  - text: did you see the waiter's hands?
  utter_qa_pair_2378:
  - text: no.
  utter_qa_pair_2379:
  - text: he had dirty fingernails.
  utter_qa_pair_2380:
  - text: really?
  utter_qa_pair_2381:
  - text: his nails were black!
  utter_qa_pair_2382:
  - text: that's disgusting.
  utter_qa_pair_2383:
  - text: and he poured water into our glasses.
  utter_qa_pair_2384:
  - text: yuck! no water for me.
  utter_qa_pair_2385:
  - text: i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2386:
  - text: this hot bread is delicious.
  utter_qa_pair_2387:
  - text: i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
  utter_qa_pair_2388:
  - text: well, i think we are paying for it.
  utter_qa_pair_2389:
  - text: no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.
  utter_qa_pair_2390:
  - text: it is delicious, especially with butter.
  utter_qa_pair_2391:
  - text: i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
  utter_qa_pair_2392:
  - text: they probably wouldn't like that.
  utter_qa_pair_2393:
  - text: i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.
  utter_qa_pair_2394:
  - text: then stop eating the bread!
  utter_qa_pair_2395:
  - text: okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please.
  utter_qa_pair_2396:
  - text: if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.
  utter_qa_pair_2397:
  - text: is this a clean restaurant?
  utter_qa_pair_2398:
  - text: well, the tables and chairs look okay.
  utter_qa_pair_2399:
  - text: okay, let's sit down.
  utter_qa_pair_2400:
  - text: check out the silverware.
  utter_qa_pair_2401:
  - text: it passes inspection.
  utter_qa_pair_2402:
  - text: here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.
  utter_qa_pair_2403:
  - text: well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here.
  utter_qa_pair_2404:
  - text: you're forgetting about the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_2405:
  - text: i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
  utter_qa_pair_2406:
  - text: you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
  utter_qa_pair_2407:
  - text: no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right
      now.
  utter_qa_pair_2408:
  - text: have you seen our waiter?
  utter_qa_pair_2409:
  - text: here he comes now.
  utter_qa_pair_2410:
  - text: we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_2411:
  - text: oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter.
  utter_qa_pair_2412:
  - text: we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
  utter_qa_pair_2413:
  - text: i'll go up front and talk to the manager.
  utter_qa_pair_2414:
  - text: that's a good idea.
  utter_qa_pair_2415:
  - text: maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
  utter_qa_pair_2416:
  - text: maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
  utter_qa_pair_2417:
  - text: every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
  utter_qa_pair_2418:
  - text: last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
  utter_qa_pair_2419:
  - text: is this table okay?
  utter_qa_pair_2420:
  - text: no, it's too close to the kitchen door.
  utter_qa_pair_2421:
  - text: how about this table?
  utter_qa_pair_2422:
  - text: no, it's too close to the front door.
  utter_qa_pair_2423:
  - text: this looks like a nice table.
  utter_qa_pair_2424:
  - text: no, it's too close to the salad bar.
  utter_qa_pair_2425:
  - text: okay, i give up.
  utter_qa_pair_2426:
  - text: well, there is one good table.
  utter_qa_pair_2427:
  - text: great. which one?
  utter_qa_pair_2428:
  - text: i don't believe the art world.
  utter_qa_pair_2429:
  - text: what is it this time?
  utter_qa_pair_2430:
  - text: an andy warhol drawing.
  utter_qa_pair_2431:
  - text: he's a famous artist.
  utter_qa_pair_2432:
  - text: he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
  utter_qa_pair_2433:
  - text: did he sign it?
  utter_qa_pair_2434:
  - text: yes.
  utter_qa_pair_2435:
  - text: is it beautiful?
  utter_qa_pair_2436:
  - text: it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!
  utter_qa_pair_2437:
  - text: so it's not worth much?
  utter_qa_pair_2438:
  - text: only about $30,000.
  utter_qa_pair_2439:
  - text: can we go to the baseball game?
  utter_qa_pair_2440:
  - text: of course.
  utter_qa_pair_2441:
  - text: i love baseball.
  utter_qa_pair_2442:
  - text: so do i.
  utter_qa_pair_2443:
  - text: i love to eat the peanuts.
  utter_qa_pair_2444:
  - text: i love to eat the hot dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_2445:
  - text: i hope we'll see a home run.
  utter_qa_pair_2446:
  - text: i hope we'll catch a foul ball.
  utter_qa_pair_2447:
  - text: bring a jacket.
  utter_qa_pair_2448:
  - text: yes. it gets a little cool at night.
  utter_qa_pair_2449:
  - text: bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
  utter_qa_pair_2450:
  - text: golf is a silly game.
  utter_qa_pair_2451:
  - text: it certainly is.
  utter_qa_pair_2452:
  - text: you hit a white ball.
  utter_qa_pair_2453:
  - text: and then you chase it.
  utter_qa_pair_2454:
  - text: and then you hit it again.
  utter_qa_pair_2455:
  - text: finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
  utter_qa_pair_2456:
  - text: you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.
  utter_qa_pair_2457:
  - text: what's the point?
  utter_qa_pair_2458:
  - text: how can it be fun?
  utter_qa_pair_2459:
  - text: they pay money to play this silly game!
  utter_qa_pair_2460:
  - text: i think golfers have a mental problem.
  utter_qa_pair_2461:
  - text: do you want to go fishing?
  utter_qa_pair_2462:
  - text: yes. that's a good idea.
  utter_qa_pair_2463:
  - text: where do you want to go?
  utter_qa_pair_2464:
  - text: we can go to the river.
  utter_qa_pair_2465:
  - text: or we can go to the lake.
  utter_qa_pair_2466:
  - text: or we can go to the ocean.
  utter_qa_pair_2467:
  - text: let's go to the lake.
  utter_qa_pair_2468:
  - text: yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.
  utter_qa_pair_2469:
  - text: we can be there in 20 minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_2470:
  - text: i'll get our fishing rods.
  utter_qa_pair_2471:
  - text: i'll get the bait.
  utter_qa_pair_2472:
  - text: baseball is fun.
  utter_qa_pair_2473:
  - text: i like to hit the ball.
  utter_qa_pair_2474:
  - text: i like to run around the bases.
  utter_qa_pair_2475:
  - text: i like to slide into the bases.
  utter_qa_pair_2476:
  - text: yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.
  utter_qa_pair_2477:
  - text: i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.
  utter_qa_pair_2478:
  - text: me too. i want to play for the yankees.
  utter_qa_pair_2479:
  - text: not me. i want to play for the dodgers.
  utter_qa_pair_2480:
  - text: we have to practice every day.
  utter_qa_pair_2481:
  - text: i don't like practice.
  utter_qa_pair_2482:
  - text: me neither. it's boring.
  utter_qa_pair_2483:
  - text: let's go jogging.
  utter_qa_pair_2484:
  - text: that's a good idea.
  utter_qa_pair_2485:
  - text: i bought some new shoes.
  utter_qa_pair_2486:
  - text: are they comfortable?
  utter_qa_pair_2487:
  - text: they're very comfortable.
  utter_qa_pair_2488:
  - text: how much were they?
  utter_qa_pair_2489:
  - text: they were on sale for $80.
  utter_qa_pair_2490:
  - text: do they help you run faster?
  utter_qa_pair_2491:
  - text: no, but my feet don't hurt anymore.
  utter_qa_pair_2492:
  - text: then they're worth every penny.
  utter_qa_pair_2493:
  - text: you might want to buy a pair.
  utter_qa_pair_2494:
  - text: tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
  utter_qa_pair_2495:
  - text: you can say that again.
  utter_qa_pair_2496:
  - text: but i'm worried about tiger.
  utter_qa_pair_2497:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_2498:
  - text: because he likes to scuba dive.
  utter_qa_pair_2499:
  - text: what's wrong with that?
  utter_qa_pair_2500:
  - text: it can be dangerous.
  utter_qa_pair_2501:
  - text: you mean he could drown.
  utter_qa_pair_2502:
  - text: he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.
  utter_qa_pair_2503:
  - text: but he dives to relax.
  utter_qa_pair_2504:
  - text: he might relax, but it makes me nervous.
  utter_qa_pair_2505:
  - text: did you watch that golf tournament?
  utter_qa_pair_2506:
  - text: the one that tiger won?
  utter_qa_pair_2507:
  - text: how did he do it?
  utter_qa_pair_2508:
  - text: it was nothing for him.
  utter_qa_pair_2509:
  - text: he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
  utter_qa_pair_2510:
  - text: he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
  utter_qa_pair_2511:
  - text: i think he is from outer space.
  utter_qa_pair_2512:
  - text: no human could possibly play golf that well.
  utter_qa_pair_2513:
  - text: whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
  utter_qa_pair_2514:
  - text: no human can do that.
  utter_qa_pair_2515:
  - text: somebody should check his birth record.
  utter_qa_pair_2516:
  - text: who's the greatest baseball player?
  utter_qa_pair_2517:
  - text: there are so many great players.
  utter_qa_pair_2518:
  - text: yes, but who is the greatest?
  utter_qa_pair_2519:
  - text: i'd have to say babe ruth.
  utter_qa_pair_2520:
  - text: most people would say that.
  utter_qa_pair_2521:
  - text: he changed the game.
  utter_qa_pair_2522:
  - text: yes, he made the home run popular.
  utter_qa_pair_2523:
  - text: everybody loved him, all over the nation.
  utter_qa_pair_2524:
  - text: he helped make the yankees the best team ever.
  utter_qa_pair_2525:
  - text: and ruth was a good person, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2526:
  - text: he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
  utter_qa_pair_2527:
  - text: did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
  utter_qa_pair_2528:
  - text: no, please tell me.

  - text: someone punched out someone.
  utter_qa_pair_2530:
  - text: that's not nice.
  utter_qa_pair_2531:
  - text: it's worse than that.
  utter_qa_pair_2532:
  - text: how so?
  utter_qa_pair_2533:
  - text: two guys got into an argument.
  utter_qa_pair_2534:
  - text: i'll bet they were drinking.
  utter_qa_pair_2535:
  - text: a third guy punched one of the two guys.
  utter_qa_pair_2536:
  - text: i'll bet he was drinking, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2537:
  - text: the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
  utter_qa_pair_2538:
  - text: i want to go to the ball game.
  utter_qa_pair_2539:
  - text: is there a game tonight?
  utter_qa_pair_2540:
  - text: yes, it starts at 7 p.m.
  utter_qa_pair_2541:
  - text: can we get tickets?
  utter_qa_pair_2542:
  - text: yes, but only the cheap tickets.
  utter_qa_pair_2543:
  - text: how much are they?
  utter_qa_pair_2544:
  - text: they're only $5 each.
  utter_qa_pair_2545:
  - text: that's a good price.
  utter_qa_pair_2546:
  - text: yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
  utter_qa_pair_2547:
  - text: where are the seats?
  utter_qa_pair_2548:
  - text: they're behind the outfield.
  utter_qa_pair_2549:
  - text: golf is so hard.
  utter_qa_pair_2550:
  - text: what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
  utter_qa_pair_2551:
  - text: it's hard if you want to do it right.
  utter_qa_pair_2552:
  - text: you mean like tiger?
  utter_qa_pair_2553:
  - text: no, like a good amateur golfer.
  utter_qa_pair_2554:
  - text: what's so hard about golf?
  utter_qa_pair_2555:
  - text: there are so many things you have to do right.
  utter_qa_pair_2556:
  - text: like what?
  utter_qa_pair_2557:
  - text: like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
  utter_qa_pair_2558:
  - text: yikes! who can remember all that?
  utter_qa_pair_2559:
  - text: you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
  utter_qa_pair_2560:
  - text: did you hear about the ball player?
  utter_qa_pair_2561:
  - text: the home run hitter on drugs?
  utter_qa_pair_2562:
  - text: he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
  utter_qa_pair_2563:
  - text: he said he wasn't using drugs.
  utter_qa_pair_2564:
  - text: he apologized to the fans.
  utter_qa_pair_2565:
  - text: the league suspended him for 50 games.
  utter_qa_pair_2566:
  - text: that will cost him some money.
  utter_qa_pair_2567:
  - text: yes, about $7 million.
  utter_qa_pair_2568:
  - text: that will teach him a good lesson.
  utter_qa_pair_2569:
  - text: he probably won't use drugs anymore.
  utter_qa_pair_2570:
  - text: but it won't stop other players from using drugs.
  utter_qa_pair_2571:
  - text: why is there so much crime?
  utter_qa_pair_2572:
  - text: because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
  utter_qa_pair_2573:
  - text: is that it?
  utter_qa_pair_2574:
  - text: also, there aren't enough police.
  utter_qa_pair_2575:
  - text: but there are a lot of police.
  utter_qa_pair_2576:
  - text: there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.
  utter_qa_pair_2577:
  - text: can't we hire more police?
  utter_qa_pair_2578:
  - text: no. it costs too much money.
  utter_qa_pair_2579:
  - text: doesn't crime cost more than police?
  utter_qa_pair_2580:
  - text: yes, it does.
  utter_qa_pair_2581:
  - text: so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
  utter_qa_pair_2582:
  - text: this is a great neighborhood.
  utter_qa_pair_2583:
  - text: yes, it is.
  utter_qa_pair_2584:
  - text: people are friendly.
  utter_qa_pair_2585:
  - text: yes, they are.
  utter_qa_pair_2586:
  - text: the streets and sidewalks are clean.
  utter_qa_pair_2587:
  - text: yes, they are.
  utter_qa_pair_2588:
  - text: there's a real nice park nearby.
  utter_qa_pair_2589:
  - text: yes, there is.
  utter_qa_pair_2590:
  - text: i feel safe here.
  utter_qa_pair_2591:
  - text: there is no crime here.
  utter_qa_pair_2592:
  - text: i wish i could move here.
  utter_qa_pair_2593:
  - text: the house burned down.
  utter_qa_pair_2594:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_2595:
  - text: the man fell asleep.
  utter_qa_pair_2596:
  - text: was he smoking?
  utter_qa_pair_2597:
  - text: yes, he was smoking a cigarette.
  utter_qa_pair_2598:
  - text: did he die?
  utter_qa_pair_2599:
  - text: yes, he did. his cat died, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2600:
  - text: that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?
  utter_qa_pair_2601:
  - text: the battery was dead.
  utter_qa_pair_2602:
  - text: a good battery would have saved his life.
  utter_qa_pair_2603:
  - text: he had cigarettes, but no battery.
  utter_qa_pair_2604:
  - text: they say he has started fifteen big fires.
  utter_qa_pair_2605:
  - text: he's been in jail three times already.
  utter_qa_pair_2606:
  - text: why did they ever let him out?
  utter_qa_pair_2607:
  - text: it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.
  utter_qa_pair_2608:
  - text: why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.
  utter_qa_pair_2609:
  - text: i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
  utter_qa_pair_2610:
  - text: but his latest fire killed someone.
  utter_qa_pair_2611:
  - text: this time they have charged him with murder.
  utter_qa_pair_2612:
  - text: so maybe he'll go to jail forever?
  utter_qa_pair_2613:
  - text: i sure hope so.
  utter_qa_pair_2614:
  - text: someone should set him on fire.
  utter_qa_pair_2615:
  - text: put your seatbelt on.
  utter_qa_pair_2616:
  - text: why?
  utter_qa_pair_2617:
  - text: because it will protect you in case of an accident.
  utter_qa_pair_2618:
  - text: but it's uncomfortable.
  utter_qa_pair_2619:
  - text: it's the law.
  utter_qa_pair_2620:
  - text: it's so much trouble.
  utter_qa_pair_2621:
  - text: it's common sense.
  utter_qa_pair_2622:
  - text: it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.
  utter_qa_pair_2623:
  - text: hold your breath till we get there.
  utter_qa_pair_2624:
  - text: okay, my seatbelt is on.
  utter_qa_pair_2625:
  - text: i'm glad you don't complain very much.
  utter_qa_pair_2626:
  - text: what are you doing?
  utter_qa_pair_2627:
  - text: i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.
  utter_qa_pair_2628:
  - text: what are you standing on?
  utter_qa_pair_2629:
  - text: a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
  utter_qa_pair_2630:
  - text: are you crazy?
  utter_qa_pair_2631:
  - text: what's the matter?
  utter_qa_pair_2632:
  - text: those books will slip and you'll fall.
  utter_qa_pair_2633:
  - text: it's only a couple of feet.
  utter_qa_pair_2634:
  - text: what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and
      pieces go into your eyes?
  utter_qa_pair_2635:
  - text: i never thought about that.
  utter_qa_pair_2636:
  - text: you'd be blind for the rest of your life!
  utter_qa_pair_2637:
  - text: did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
  utter_qa_pair_2638:
  - text: yes. i called for a clean-up.
  utter_qa_pair_2639:
  - text: a puddle of water is very dangerous.
  utter_qa_pair_2640:
  - text: it isn't easy to see.
  utter_qa_pair_2641:
  - text: but it's real easy to slip on.
  utter_qa_pair_2642:
  - text: especially on these slick floors.
  utter_qa_pair_2643:
  - text: someone who slips could hurt their back.
  utter_qa_pair_2644:
  - text: they could even crack their head open.
  utter_qa_pair_2645:
  - text: we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
  utter_qa_pair_2646:
  - text: we can leave if we put an orange cone here.
  utter_qa_pair_2647:
  - text: yes, but i don't know where the orange cones are.
  utter_qa_pair_2648:
  - text: what happens when the fire alarm rings?
  utter_qa_pair_2649:
  - text: we tell our students to leave the classroom.
  utter_qa_pair_2650:
  - text: can they take their belongings?
  utter_qa_pair_2651:
  - text: yes, if they do it quickly.
  utter_qa_pair_2652:
  - text: where do the students go?
  utter_qa_pair_2653:
  - text: they go out to the north parking lot.
  utter_qa_pair_2654:
  - text: what do the teachers do?
  utter_qa_pair_2655:
  - text: we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
  utter_qa_pair_2656:
  - text: why do you do that?
  utter_qa_pair_2657:
  - text: we want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
  utter_qa_pair_2658:
  - text: if they are all outside, then what?
  utter_qa_pair_2659:
  - text: i have to go back upstairs.
  utter_qa_pair_2660:
  - text: why? we're already late.
  utter_qa_pair_2661:
  - text: i have to check the stove.
  utter_qa_pair_2662:
  - text: what's the matter?
  utter_qa_pair_2663:
  - text: maybe i left the burner on.
  utter_qa_pair_2664:
  - text: no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left.
  utter_qa_pair_2665:
  - text: are you sure?
  utter_qa_pair_2666:
  - text: of course i'm sure.
  utter_qa_pair_2667:
  - text: well, i have to go back upstairs anyway.
  utter_qa_pair_2668:
  - text: it's getting later every minute.
  utter_qa_pair_2669:
  - text: i think i left the water running.
  utter_qa_pair_2670:
  - text: the city is buying guns.
  utter_qa_pair_2671:
  - text: what are they paying?
  utter_qa_pair_2672:
  - text: up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.
  utter_qa_pair_2673:
  - text: why are they doing this?
  utter_qa_pair_2674:
  - text: they want to get guns off the street.
  utter_qa_pair_2675:
  - text: who would turn in a gun for $200?
  utter_qa_pair_2676:
  - text: that isn't a good deal?
  utter_qa_pair_2677:
  - text: a good gun costs $400 or more.
  utter_qa_pair_2678:
  - text: well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.
  utter_qa_pair_2679:
  - text: i'll keep my receipt and my gun.
  utter_qa_pair_2680:
  - text: i didn't know you had a gun.
  utter_qa_pair_2681:
  - text: you're yawning.
  utter_qa_pair_2682:
  - text: i sure am.
  utter_qa_pair_2683:
  - text: you should go to bed.
  utter_qa_pair_2684:
  - text: i will as soon as i finish this article.
  utter_qa_pair_2685:
  - text: what are you reading?
  utter_qa_pair_2686:
  - text: it's about crime in los angeles.
  utter_qa_pair_2687:
  - text: what does it say?
  utter_qa_pair_2688:
  - text: the mayor says the crime rate is going down.
  utter_qa_pair_2689:
  - text: then why does everyone lock their doors?
  utter_qa_pair_2690:
  - text: i guess they haven't read this article.
  utter_qa_pair_2691:
  - text: no one believes that the crime rate is going down.
  utter_qa_pair_2692:
  - text: people who live in california are crazy.
  utter_qa_pair_2693:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_2694:
  - text: because of all the earthquakes and fires.
  utter_qa_pair_2695:
  - text: but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
  utter_qa_pair_2696:
  - text: once in a while is once too many.
  utter_qa_pair_2697:
  - text: but you're right. there are a lot of fires.
  utter_qa_pair_2698:
  - text: a recent fire destroyed 85 homes.
  utter_qa_pair_2699:
  - text: still, it's safer than florida.
  utter_qa_pair_2700:
  - text: florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.
  utter_qa_pair_2701:
  - text: no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october.
  utter_qa_pair_2702:
  - text: but most of those hurricanes are harmless.
  utter_qa_pair_2703:
  - text: i went to hawaii on vacation.
  utter_qa_pair_2704:
  - text: did you like it?
  utter_qa_pair_2705:
  - text: i loved it. i want to live there.
  utter_qa_pair_2706:
  - text: what did you like?
  utter_qa_pair_2707:
  - text: the island is so green, and the water is so blue.
  utter_qa_pair_2708:
  - text: did you go swimming?
  utter_qa_pair_2709:
  - text: i went to the beach every day.
  utter_qa_pair_2710:
  - text: how was the weather?
  utter_qa_pair_2711:
  - text: it was hot and sunny every day.
  utter_qa_pair_2712:
  - text: what did you do at night?
  utter_qa_pair_2713:
  - text: at night i went out to eat. the food was delicious.
  utter_qa_pair_2714:
  - text: i like this hotel.
  utter_qa_pair_2715:
  - text: what do you like about it?
  utter_qa_pair_2716:
  - text: we get a free breakfast.
  utter_qa_pair_2717:
  - text: coffee and a roll?
  utter_qa_pair_2718:
  - text: no, a real breakfast.
  utter_qa_pair_2719:
  - text: bacon and eggs?
  utter_qa_pair_2720:
  - text: with toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.
  utter_qa_pair_2721:
  - text: wow! that is nice. let's stay for two nights.
  utter_qa_pair_2722:
  - text: and the rooms are clean, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2723:
  - text: do they allow pets?
  utter_qa_pair_2724:
  - text: no pets, no smoking.
  utter_qa_pair_2725:
  - text: i'm not sleeping here tonight.
  utter_qa_pair_2726:
  - text: what's the matter? this is a nice room.
  utter_qa_pair_2727:
  - text: maybe the room is nice, but not the bed.
  utter_qa_pair_2728:
  - text: what's wrong with the bed?
  utter_qa_pair_2729:
  - text: look at this sheet.
  utter_qa_pair_2730:
  - text: yes?
  utter_qa_pair_2731:
  - text: see those stains?
  utter_qa_pair_2732:
  - text: i sure do.
  utter_qa_pair_2733:
  - text: i'm not sleeping on that sheet.
  utter_qa_pair_2734:
  - text: well, just call the front desk. they'll give us new sheets.
  utter_qa_pair_2735:
  - text: i want sheets without stains on them.
  utter_qa_pair_2736:
  - text: what time does your plane leave?
  utter_qa_pair_2737:
  - text: it leaves at 12:15.
  utter_qa_pair_2738:
  - text: when do you have to be at the airport?
  utter_qa_pair_2739:
  - text: i have to be there two hours early.
  utter_qa_pair_2740:
  - text: so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
  utter_qa_pair_2741:
  - text: that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
  utter_qa_pair_2742:
  - text: well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.
  utter_qa_pair_2743:
  - text: so maybe we better leave at 8:15?
  utter_qa_pair_2744:
  - text: yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.
  utter_qa_pair_2745:
  - text: i agree.
  utter_qa_pair_2746:
  - text: you never know what might happen on these freeways.
  utter_qa_pair_2747:
  - text: i need to fly to new york.
  utter_qa_pair_2748:
  - text: when are you going?
  utter_qa_pair_2749:
  - text: during the christmas holidays.
  utter_qa_pair_2750:
  - text: you'd better buy your ticket now.
  utter_qa_pair_2751:
  - text: you must be kidding.
  utter_qa_pair_2752:
  - text: no, i'm not. it's march. time is running out. seats are selling out right
      now.
  utter_qa_pair_2753:
  - text: i thought i would wait until october.
  utter_qa_pair_2754:
  - text: i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas.
  utter_qa_pair_2755:
  - text: you're right.
  utter_qa_pair_2756:
  - text: well, listen to me. you need to buy a ticket now.
  utter_qa_pair_2757:
  - text: but maybe prices will be cheaper in october.
  utter_qa_pair_2758:
  - text: i hate flying.
  utter_qa_pair_2759:
  - text: so do i.
  utter_qa_pair_2760:
  - text: a long time ago, flying used to be okay.
  utter_qa_pair_2761:
  - text: now it's like riding a bus.
  utter_qa_pair_2762:
  - text: you're jammed in with people all around you.
  utter_qa_pair_2763:
  - text: half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing.
  utter_qa_pair_2764:
  - text: you don't have any elbow room or knee room.
  utter_qa_pair_2765:
  - text: people are always getting up to use the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_2766:
  - text: kids are crying or climbing over you.
  utter_qa_pair_2767:
  - text: it's a flying zoo!
  utter_qa_pair_2768:
  - text: i wish i could afford first class seats.
  utter_qa_pair_2769:
  - text: some guy rowed across the atlantic ocean.
  utter_qa_pair_2770:
  - text: good for him.
  utter_qa_pair_2771:
  - text: why would he do that?
  utter_qa_pair_2772:
  - text: did he set a new record?
  utter_qa_pair_2773:
  - text: yes, i think he did.
  utter_qa_pair_2774:
  - text: well, i guess that's why he did it.
  utter_qa_pair_2775:
  - text: what's the point?
  utter_qa_pair_2776:
  - text: now he has the world record!
  utter_qa_pair_2777:
  - text: but someone's going to break it, so what good is it?
  utter_qa_pair_2778:
  - text: well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.
  utter_qa_pair_2779:
  - text: i don't think he even got paid for it.
  utter_qa_pair_2780:
  - text: i want to go on a cruise ship.
  utter_qa_pair_2781:
  - text: that sounds like fun. where do you want to go?
  utter_qa_pair_2782:
  - text: i want to cruise to hawaii.
  utter_qa_pair_2783:
  - text: that should be a nice trip. lots of fun, and lots of food.
  utter_qa_pair_2784:
  - text: i have no idea how much it will cost.
  utter_qa_pair_2785:
  - text: i think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
  utter_qa_pair_2786:
  - text: well, of course i want to go when the weather is nice.
  utter_qa_pair_2787:
  - text: yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms.
  utter_qa_pair_2788:
  - text: and i want to get a big cabin with a view.
  utter_qa_pair_2789:
  - text: are you going to travel alone?
  utter_qa_pair_2790:
  - text: no, my sister and i will travel together.
  utter_qa_pair_2791:
  - text: i hate to fly.
  utter_qa_pair_2792:
  - text: because of all the security?
  utter_qa_pair_2793:
  - text: no, because it hurts my ears.
  utter_qa_pair_2794:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2795:
  - text: every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.
  utter_qa_pair_2796:
  - text: that's just the altitude change, i think.
  utter_qa_pair_2797:
  - text: whatever it is, it hurts.
  utter_qa_pair_2798:
  - text: can't you take medicine or something for it?
  utter_qa_pair_2799:
  - text: i've tried everything, but nothing works.
  utter_qa_pair_2800:
  - text: have you tried earplugs?
  utter_qa_pair_2801:
  - text: they don't work, either.
  utter_qa_pair_2802:
  - text: spring break starts tomorrow.
  utter_qa_pair_2803:
  - text: are you going to go anywhere?
  utter_qa_pair_2804:
  - text: i was thinking of driving to arizona.
  utter_qa_pair_2805:
  - text: to the grand canyon?
  utter_qa_pair_2806:
  - text: yes. i've never been there.
  utter_qa_pair_2807:
  - text: i was there when i was a kid.
  utter_qa_pair_2808:
  - text: how did you like it?
  utter_qa_pair_2809:
  - text: i loved it. i still remember how amazing it was.
  utter_qa_pair_2810:
  - text: i'm sure i'll like it, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2811:
  - text: you should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
  utter_qa_pair_2812:
  - text: no way! i don't want to fall to my death.
  utter_qa_pair_2813:
  - text: that hotel was terrible.
  utter_qa_pair_2814:
  - text: the worst in the whole world.
  utter_qa_pair_2815:
  - text: the walls were so thin.
  utter_qa_pair_2816:
  - text: all day long we heard tvs or telephones.
  utter_qa_pair_2817:
  - text: all night long we heard people snoring.
  utter_qa_pair_2818:
  - text: housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.
  utter_qa_pair_2819:
  - text: room service brought us a cold dinner.
  utter_qa_pair_2820:
  - text: our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.
  utter_qa_pair_2821:
  - text: our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
  utter_qa_pair_2822:
  - text: they added phony charges to our bill.
  utter_qa_pair_2823:
  - text: how did we end up in that terrible hotel?
  utter_qa_pair_2824:
  - text: i have to hang up. i'm so sleepy.
  utter_qa_pair_2825:
  - text: it's not even 10 o'clock.
  utter_qa_pair_2826:
  - text: i'm falling asleep on the phone.
  utter_qa_pair_2827:
  - text: you got up real early.
  utter_qa_pair_2828:
  - text: i had to take my friend to the airport.
  utter_qa_pair_2829:
  - text: why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
  utter_qa_pair_2830:
  - text: i didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.
  utter_qa_pair_2831:
  - text: why is that?
  utter_qa_pair_2832:
  - text: there was a bomb threat at the airport.
  utter_qa_pair_2833:
  - text: only a threat?
  utter_qa_pair_2834:
  - text: yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.
  utter_qa_pair_2835:
  - text: my dad went to washington, d.c.
  utter_qa_pair_2836:
  - text: why did he do that?
  utter_qa_pair_2837:
  - text: he was invited, along with about 90 other veterans.
  utter_qa_pair_2838:
  - text: who invited them?
  utter_qa_pair_2839:
  - text: some private organization.
  utter_qa_pair_2840:
  - text: why did they invite him?
  utter_qa_pair_2841:
  - text: to thank him and all the other soldiers who served in world war ii.
  utter_qa_pair_2842:
  - text: that's very nice.
  utter_qa_pair_2843:
  - text: my dad got to see the beautiful new world war ii monument.
  utter_qa_pair_2844:
  - text: that trip must have cost a lot of money.
  utter_qa_pair_2845:
  - text: that was a great trip to washington, d.c.
  utter_qa_pair_2846:
  - text: tell me about it, dad.
  utter_qa_pair_2847:
  - text: about 90 of us world war ii veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m.
  utter_qa_pair_2848:
  - text: how long was the flight?
  utter_qa_pair_2849:
  - text: it only took about two hours.
  utter_qa_pair_2850:
  - text: did you take pictures at the world war ii monument?
  utter_qa_pair_2851:
  - text: oh, yes. we all took lots of pictures.
  utter_qa_pair_2852:
  - text: then you flew back home that evening?
  utter_qa_pair_2853:
  - text: yes. when we landed, tv reporters and the army band were there.
  utter_qa_pair_2854:
  - text: that must have made you feel really special.
  utter_qa_pair_2855:
  - text: oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us.
  utter_qa_pair_2856:
  - text: i need a job.
  utter_qa_pair_2857:
  - text: i thought you had a job.
  utter_qa_pair_2858:
  - text: i did.
  utter_qa_pair_2859:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_2860:
  - text: i got laid off.
  utter_qa_pair_2861:
  - text: that's terrible! when did it happen?
  utter_qa_pair_2862:
  - text: i got laid off last week.
  utter_qa_pair_2863:
  - text: just you?
  utter_qa_pair_2864:
  - text: no, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2865:
  - text: what are you going to do?
  utter_qa_pair_2866:
  - text: i'm looking in the newspaper for a job.
  utter_qa_pair_2867:
  - text: before you go to that interview, check yourself.
  utter_qa_pair_2868:
  - text: what's to check?
  utter_qa_pair_2869:
  - text: are your nails clean?
  utter_qa_pair_2870:
  - text: yes, they are.
  utter_qa_pair_2871:
  - text: did you double-check your nose and teeth?
  utter_qa_pair_2872:
  - text: they are clean, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2873:
  - text: did you shine your shoes?
  utter_qa_pair_2874:
  - text: my shoes are shined.
  utter_qa_pair_2875:
  - text: do your socks match?
  utter_qa_pair_2876:
  - text: of course they match.
  utter_qa_pair_2877:
  - text: no, they don't. one is black and one is dark blue.
  utter_qa_pair_2878:
  - text: life is hard.
  utter_qa_pair_2879:
  - text: it sure is.
  utter_qa_pair_2880:
  - text: i thought school was hard.
  utter_qa_pair_2881:
  - text: me, too. i couldn't wait to graduate.
  utter_qa_pair_2882:
  - text: but now work is hard, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2883:
  - text: i agree. work is just as hard as school.
  utter_qa_pair_2884:
  - text: sometimes i wish i was back in school.
  utter_qa_pair_2885:
  - text: me, too. school was fun.
  utter_qa_pair_2886:
  - text: and it was only 12 years.
  utter_qa_pair_2887:
  - text: it went by pretty fast.
  utter_qa_pair_2888:
  - text: but work goes on forever!
  utter_qa_pair_2889:
  - text: i'm sleepy.
  utter_qa_pair_2890:
  - text: so am i.
  utter_qa_pair_2891:
  - text: i had a long day.
  utter_qa_pair_2892:
  - text: so did i.
  utter_qa_pair_2893:
  - text: i didn't even have lunch.
  utter_qa_pair_2894:
  - text: neither did i.
  utter_qa_pair_2895:
  - text: i was busy the whole day.
  utter_qa_pair_2896:
  - text: so was i.
  utter_qa_pair_2897:
  - text: i had to bring work home with me.
  utter_qa_pair_2898:
  - text: i did too.
  utter_qa_pair_2899:
  - text: your day was just like mine.
  utter_qa_pair_2900:
  - text: i don't like my job.
  utter_qa_pair_2901:
  - text: what do you do?
  utter_qa_pair_2902:
  - text: i'm a babysitter.
  utter_qa_pair_2903:
  - text: is that a lot of work?
  utter_qa_pair_2904:
  - text: babies cry all the time.
  utter_qa_pair_2905:
  - text: you have to change their diapers.
  utter_qa_pair_2906:
  - text: i have to feed them.
  utter_qa_pair_2907:
  - text: are you looking for another job?
  utter_qa_pair_2908:
  - text: no, i'm looking for another family.
  utter_qa_pair_2909:
  - text: another family?
  utter_qa_pair_2910:
  - text: a family with only one baby.
  utter_qa_pair_2911:
  - text: i need a job.
  utter_qa_pair_2912:
  - text: what was your last job?
  utter_qa_pair_2913:
  - text: i was a painter.
  utter_qa_pair_2914:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_2915:
  - text: i got laid off because there was no work.
  utter_qa_pair_2916:
  - text: what else can you do?
  utter_qa_pair_2917:
  - text: i'm a handyman.
  utter_qa_pair_2918:
  - text: can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?
  utter_qa_pair_2919:
  - text: of course.
  utter_qa_pair_2920:
  - text: then i have a job for you in my kitchen.
  utter_qa_pair_2921:
  - text: it will cost you only $20 plus parts.
  utter_qa_pair_2922:
  - text: what would you do if you lost your job?
  utter_qa_pair_2923:
  - text: i have no idea. i've been here for 20 years.
  utter_qa_pair_2924:
  - text: do you have any other skills?
  utter_qa_pair_2925:
  - text: well, i know how to flip hamburgers.
  utter_qa_pair_2926:
  - text: no one would hire you to flip hamburgers.
  utter_qa_pair_2927:
  - text: have you heard something that you're not telling me?
  utter_qa_pair_2928:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2929:
  - text: are there going to be layoffs at this place?
  utter_qa_pair_2930:
  - text: i certainly hope not!
  utter_qa_pair_2931:
  - text: if you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.
  utter_qa_pair_2932:
  - text: oh great, we could both work at burger king.
  utter_qa_pair_2933:
  - text: do your students ever talk about their jobs?
  utter_qa_pair_2934:
  - text: yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best.
  utter_qa_pair_2935:
  - text: i tell my students to become a teacher.
  utter_qa_pair_2936:
  - text: teaching is a great job.
  utter_qa_pair_2937:
  - text: it's the best job i've ever had.
  utter_qa_pair_2938:
  - text: what makes it so good?
  utter_qa_pair_2939:
  - text: for me, it's the students.
  utter_qa_pair_2940:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_2941:
  - text: i mean i have wonderful students.
  utter_qa_pair_2942:
  - text: that must be nice.
  utter_qa_pair_2943:
  - text: teaching is the best part of my whole day.
  utter_qa_pair_2944:
  - text: boy, i'm glad that job is finished.
  utter_qa_pair_2945:
  - text: how long did it take?
  utter_qa_pair_2946:
  - text: four hours, without a break.
  utter_qa_pair_2947:
  - text: it's always nice to finish a job.
  utter_qa_pair_2948:
  - text: well, it's good and bad.
  utter_qa_pair_2949:
  - text: what's bad about it?
  utter_qa_pair_2950:
  - text: when you finish, all you do is start another job!
  utter_qa_pair_2951:
  - text: yes, that's right. it does get boring.
  utter_qa_pair_2952:
  - text: especially if it's the same work, over and over.
  utter_qa_pair_2953:
  - text: but that's what most people do.
  utter_qa_pair_2954:
  - text: yes, i guess most of us are stuck in a routine.
  utter_qa_pair_2955:
  - text: i think i have the worst boss in the world.
  utter_qa_pair_2956:
  - text: what makes him so bad?
  utter_qa_pair_2957:
  - text: he's rude and he yells a lot.
  utter_qa_pair_2958:
  - text: that's hard to take.
  utter_qa_pair_2959:
  - text: i've never heard him say please or thank you.
  utter_qa_pair_2960:
  - text: he sounds like a real jerk.
  utter_qa_pair_2961:
  - text: no one at work likes him.
  utter_qa_pair_2962:
  - text: can't you report him to his supervisor?
  utter_qa_pair_2963:
  - text: of course not. if i do that, i'll lose my job.
  utter_qa_pair_2964:
  - text: yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.
  utter_qa_pair_2965:
  - text: i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary.
  utter_qa_pair_2966:
  - text: what are we going to do?
  utter_qa_pair_2967:
  - text: about what?
  utter_qa_pair_2968:
  - text: about finding a job for me.
  utter_qa_pair_2969:
  - text: you don't need a job. i make enough money for both of us.
  utter_qa_pair_2970:
  - text: that doesn't matter. i don't want to sit around.
  utter_qa_pair_2971:
  - text: okay, what kind of job do you want?
  utter_qa_pair_2972:
  - text: i'm not sure.
  utter_qa_pair_2973:
  - text: well, you should do something that you enjoy.
  utter_qa_pair_2974:
  - text: i enjoy selling. i was born to sell.
  utter_qa_pair_2975:
  - text: okay, what do you want to sell?
  utter_qa_pair_2976:
  - text: cigarette lighters. i'll make a fortune.
  utter_qa_pair_2977:
  - text: a new hotel is looking for workers.
  utter_qa_pair_2978:
  - text: yes, i saw it on the tv news.
  utter_qa_pair_2979:
  - text: they need 300 new workers.
  utter_qa_pair_2980:
  - text: and 4,000 people showed up.
  utter_qa_pair_2981:
  - text: so many people are out of work.
  utter_qa_pair_2982:
  - text: i still have my job, thank goodness.
  utter_qa_pair_2983:
  - text: so do i, but i'm worried.
  utter_qa_pair_2984:
  - text: me too. there are no guarantees.
  utter_qa_pair_2985:
  - text: if you lose your job, you can move in with me.
  utter_qa_pair_2986:
  - text: oh, thank you. that's very nice of you.
  utter_qa_pair_2987:
  - text: you would do the same for me.
  utter_qa_pair_2988:
  - text: i think i did something real stupid.
  utter_qa_pair_2989:
  - text: what did you do?
  utter_qa_pair_2990:
  - text: i bought some stock.
  utter_qa_pair_2991:
  - text: everybody buys stock.
  utter_qa_pair_2992:
  - text: i bought it on a hunch.
  utter_qa_pair_2993:
  - text: you didn't read about the company first?
  utter_qa_pair_2994:
  - text: i didn't have to. it's been in business for 60 years.
  utter_qa_pair_2995:
  - text: so what's the problem?
  utter_qa_pair_2996:
  - text: i used all my savings on this one company.
  utter_qa_pair_2997:
  - text: you put all your eggs into one basket.
  utter_qa_pair_2998:
  - text: if the company goes out of business, i'll have nothing.
  utter_qa_pair_2999:
  - text: i was going to be a doctor.
  utter_qa_pair_3000:
  - text: what happened to your plans?
  utter_qa_pair_3001:
  - text: i got a d in college chemistry.
  utter_qa_pair_3002:
  - text: well, a d is better than an f.
  utter_qa_pair_3003:
  - text: a tutor helped me get the d!
  utter_qa_pair_3004:
  - text: so, you didn't become a doctor.
  utter_qa_pair_3005:
  - text: and now i'm glad that i didn't.
  utter_qa_pair_3006:
  - text: why's that?
  utter_qa_pair_3007:
  - text: a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
  utter_qa_pair_3008:
  - text: oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.
  utter_qa_pair_3009:
  - text: if you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.
  utter_qa_pair_3010:
  - text: i want to be a mail carrier when i grow up.
  utter_qa_pair_3011:
  - text: why?
  utter_qa_pair_3012:
  - text: because you get to meet a lot of people.
  utter_qa_pair_3013:
  - text: you sure do.
  utter_qa_pair_3014:
  - text: and you get a lot of exercise every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3015:
  - text: that's the truth.
  utter_qa_pair_3016:
  - text: and you get to play with a lot of dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_3017:
  - text: well, you're supposed to be working.
  utter_qa_pair_3018:
  - text: yes, but i will always pet the friendly dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_3019:
  - text: what about the unfriendly dogs?
  utter_qa_pair_3020:
  - text: i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.
  utter_qa_pair_3021:
  - text: i want to move to new york.
  utter_qa_pair_3022:
  - text: to the state or the city?
  utter_qa_pair_3023:
  - text: to the city, of course.
  utter_qa_pair_3024:
  - text: why do you want to move there?
  utter_qa_pair_3025:
  - text: because i want to make a lot of money.
  utter_qa_pair_3026:
  - text: there are a lot of poor people in new york.
  utter_qa_pair_3027:
  - text: there sure areÂ—at least a million.
  utter_qa_pair_3028:
  - text: so how do you plan to become rich?
  utter_qa_pair_3029:
  - text: i will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
  utter_qa_pair_3030:
  - text: that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you.
  utter_qa_pair_3031:
  - text: i will keep knocking on doors.
  utter_qa_pair_3032:
  - text: i love salads.
  utter_qa_pair_3033:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_3034:
  - text: i usually eat a simple salad.
  utter_qa_pair_3035:
  - text: what do you put in it?
  utter_qa_pair_3036:
  - text: just lettuce, tomato, and celery.
  utter_qa_pair_3037:
  - text: that's it?
  utter_qa_pair_3038:
  - text: i add some pepper and salt.
  utter_qa_pair_3039:
  - text: i always put cheese in my salads.
  utter_qa_pair_3040:
  - text: yes, cheese is nice.
  utter_qa_pair_3041:
  - text: what kind of dressing do you use?
  utter_qa_pair_3042:
  - text: i pour lots of french dressing on top.
  utter_qa_pair_3043:
  - text: i love cheese.
  utter_qa_pair_3044:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_3045:
  - text: where does cheese come from?
  utter_qa_pair_3046:
  - text: it comes from cows.
  utter_qa_pair_3047:
  - text: so we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?
  utter_qa_pair_3048:
  - text: yes, we do.
  utter_qa_pair_3049:
  - text: what else do we get from cows?
  utter_qa_pair_3050:
  - text: we get hamburgers and steak.
  utter_qa_pair_3051:
  - text: oh, that's so delicious.
  utter_qa_pair_3052:
  - text: we also get leather.
  utter_qa_pair_3053:
  - text: we get a lot of things from cows, don't we?
  utter_qa_pair_3054:
  - text: i used to work in a deli.
  utter_qa_pair_3055:
  - text: how did you like it?
  utter_qa_pair_3056:
  - text: i loved it!
  utter_qa_pair_3057:
  - text: did you get free food?
  utter_qa_pair_3058:
  - text: i ate free cheese and meat every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3059:
  - text: that sounds like a great job.
  utter_qa_pair_3060:
  - text: whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me.
  utter_qa_pair_3061:
  - text: did you get fat?
  utter_qa_pair_3062:
  - text: no, but i did put on a few pounds.
  utter_qa_pair_3063:
  - text: that sounds like a dream job.
  utter_qa_pair_3064:
  - text: it was, until one day my manager caught me.
  utter_qa_pair_3065:
  - text: i'm on a new diet.
  utter_qa_pair_3066:
  - text: what are you eating now?
  utter_qa_pair_3067:
  - text: i switched from pasta to potatoes.
  utter_qa_pair_3068:
  - text: why did you do that?
  utter_qa_pair_3069:
  - text: pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.
  utter_qa_pair_3070:
  - text: natural food has more vitamins.
  utter_qa_pair_3071:
  - text: and it's just as easy to prepare.
  utter_qa_pair_3072:
  - text: how do you prepare the potatoes?
  utter_qa_pair_3073:
  - text: i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_3074:
  - text: that's pretty simple.
  utter_qa_pair_3075:
  - text: then i add butter, salt, and pepper.
  utter_qa_pair_3076:
  - text: my girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
  utter_qa_pair_3077:
  - text: why was that?
  utter_qa_pair_3078:
  - text: i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.
  utter_qa_pair_3079:
  - text: what's the matter with that?
  utter_qa_pair_3080:
  - text: her mom is a great cook.
  utter_qa_pair_3081:
  - text: so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
  utter_qa_pair_3082:
  - text: it hurt her feelings.
  utter_qa_pair_3083:
  - text: oh.
  utter_qa_pair_3084:
  - text: i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset.
  utter_qa_pair_3085:
  - text: maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
  utter_qa_pair_3086:
  - text: i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
  utter_qa_pair_3087:
  - text: i eat the same thing every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3088:
  - text: you're kidding.
  utter_qa_pair_3089:
  - text: no, i'm serious.
  utter_qa_pair_3090:
  - text: doesn't that get old?
  utter_qa_pair_3091:
  - text: no, because i'm eating food that i like.
  utter_qa_pair_3092:
  - text: but the same thing day after day gets old.
  utter_qa_pair_3093:
  - text: well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different.
  utter_qa_pair_3094:
  - text: do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
  utter_qa_pair_3095:
  - text: no, i hate vegetables.
  utter_qa_pair_3096:
  - text: but you eat fruits.
  utter_qa_pair_3097:
  - text: i eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3098:
  - text: there's something wrong with my orange.

  - text: what's wrong?
  utter_qa_pair_3100:
  - text: it's not orange!
  utter_qa_pair_3101:
  - text: your orange isn't orange?
  utter_qa_pair_3102:
  - text: no, it's dark pink!
  utter_qa_pair_3103:
  - text: are you sure? i never heard of such a thing.
  utter_qa_pair_3104:
  - text: i just peeled it, and i'm looking at it right now.
  utter_qa_pair_3105:
  - text: let me see. yes, you're right. your orange is pink.
  utter_qa_pair_3106:
  - text: who ever heard of such a thing?
  utter_qa_pair_3107:
  - text: oh, look. here's the little sticker that was on it. it's called a pink navel.
  utter_qa_pair_3108:
  - text: what is this world coming to?
  utter_qa_pair_3109:
  - text: i love peanuts.
  utter_qa_pair_3110:
  - text: me, too. i love them roasted and salted.
  utter_qa_pair_3111:
  - text: i love boiled peanuts.
  utter_qa_pair_3112:
  - text: boiled? i never heard of that.
  utter_qa_pair_3113:
  - text: just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
  utter_qa_pair_3114:
  - text: i'll have to try them sometime.
  utter_qa_pair_3115:
  - text: they're best when they're hot.
  utter_qa_pair_3116:
  - text: my brother is allergic to peanuts.
  utter_qa_pair_3117:
  - text: that's not good.
  utter_qa_pair_3118:
  - text: no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little.
  utter_qa_pair_3119:
  - text: i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
  utter_qa_pair_3120:
  - text: i'm gaining weight.
  utter_qa_pair_3121:
  - text: how much have you gained?
  utter_qa_pair_3122:
  - text: three pounds just this month.
  utter_qa_pair_3123:
  - text: do you know why?
  utter_qa_pair_3124:
  - text: i think it's the ice cream.
  utter_qa_pair_3125:
  - text: you started eating ice cream?
  utter_qa_pair_3126:
  - text: it was on sale.
  utter_qa_pair_3127:
  - text: how much did you buy?
  utter_qa_pair_3128:
  - text: i filled up my freezer with ice cream.
  utter_qa_pair_3129:
  - text: well, it won't last forever.
  utter_qa_pair_3130:
  - text: no, i figure i'll finish it all by next week.
  utter_qa_pair_3131:
  - text: i'm stuffed.
  utter_qa_pair_3132:
  - text: of course you are. you ate everything on the table.
  utter_qa_pair_3133:
  - text: i don't like to eat leftovers.
  utter_qa_pair_3134:
  - text: i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
  utter_qa_pair_3135:
  - text: i like my food hot and fresh.
  utter_qa_pair_3136:
  - text: you like to see it disappear.
  utter_qa_pair_3137:
  - text: i don't like it reheated.
  utter_qa_pair_3138:
  - text: well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.
  utter_qa_pair_3139:
  - text: i'm so full i'm going to burst.
  utter_qa_pair_3140:
  - text: you should loosen your belt.
  utter_qa_pair_3141:
  - text: i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
  utter_qa_pair_3142:
  - text: i saw what you did.
  utter_qa_pair_3143:
  - text: i didn't do anything.
  utter_qa_pair_3144:
  - text: oh yes, you did.
  utter_qa_pair_3145:
  - text: what are you talking about?
  utter_qa_pair_3146:
  - text: you know what i'm talking about.
  utter_qa_pair_3147:
  - text: i don't have any idea.
  utter_qa_pair_3148:
  - text: you know what you did.
  utter_qa_pair_3149:
  - text: maybe i know, but how could you know?
  utter_qa_pair_3150:
  - text: because i was watching you.
  utter_qa_pair_3151:
  - text: okay, i'm sorry i did it.
  utter_qa_pair_3152:
  - text: don't drink milk out of the carton. use a glass!
  utter_qa_pair_3153:
  - text: i like that shirt.
  utter_qa_pair_3154:
  - text: so do i.
  utter_qa_pair_3155:
  - text: how much is it?
  utter_qa_pair_3156:
  - text: i don't know. the tag is missing.
  utter_qa_pair_3157:
  - text: ask the clerk.
  utter_qa_pair_3158:
  - text: i will.
  utter_qa_pair_3159:
  - text: oh, look. here's another shirt just like it.
  utter_qa_pair_3160:
  - text: does it have a price tag?
  utter_qa_pair_3161:
  - text: yes, it does. it's only $20.
  utter_qa_pair_3162:
  - text: that's a great price.
  utter_qa_pair_3163:
  - text: i think i'll buy both of them.
  utter_qa_pair_3164:
  - text: i bought you a pair of pants.
  utter_qa_pair_3165:
  - text: thank you.
  utter_qa_pair_3166:
  - text: i hope they fit.
  utter_qa_pair_3167:
  - text: i hope you kept the receipt.
  utter_qa_pair_3168:
  - text: you think they won't fit?
  utter_qa_pair_3169:
  - text: i think i've put on some weight.
  utter_qa_pair_3170:
  - text: you think?
  utter_qa_pair_3171:
  - text: maybe a pound or two.
  utter_qa_pair_3172:
  - text: maybe four or five pounds?
  utter_qa_pair_3173:
  - text: my waist is bigger than it was.
  utter_qa_pair_3174:
  - text: no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.
  utter_qa_pair_3175:
  - text: what do we need to buy?
  utter_qa_pair_3176:
  - text: let me look at our list.
  utter_qa_pair_3177:
  - text: i know that we need milk.
  utter_qa_pair_3178:
  - text: nonfat.
  utter_qa_pair_3179:
  - text: of course. what else?
  utter_qa_pair_3180:
  - text: we need cheese, bread, and ham.
  utter_qa_pair_3181:
  - text: what kind of cheese?
  utter_qa_pair_3182:
  - text: swiss.
  utter_qa_pair_3183:
  - text: of course, the cheese with holes in it.
  utter_qa_pair_3184:
  - text: i never used to buy swiss cheese.
  utter_qa_pair_3185:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_3186:
  - text: i need some pants.
  utter_qa_pair_3187:
  - text: i thought you just bought a pair.
  utter_qa_pair_3188:
  - text: i did.
  utter_qa_pair_3189:
  - text: what's wrong with them so soon?
  utter_qa_pair_3190:
  - text: the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
  utter_qa_pair_3191:
  - text: you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
  utter_qa_pair_3192:
  - text: but that's what pockets are for.
  utter_qa_pair_3193:
  - text: you should carry them in a purse.
  utter_qa_pair_3194:
  - text: i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
  utter_qa_pair_3195:
  - text: well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
  utter_qa_pair_3196:
  - text: i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.
  utter_qa_pair_3197:
  - text: what are those wipes for?
  utter_qa_pair_3198:
  - text: you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
  utter_qa_pair_3199:
  - text: that's a great idea.
  utter_qa_pair_3200:
  - text: yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
  utter_qa_pair_3201:
  - text: i'm going to take five wipes.
  utter_qa_pair_3202:
  - text: what do you need five of them for?
  utter_qa_pair_3203:
  - text: one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
  utter_qa_pair_3204:
  - text: what's the matter with the produce?
  utter_qa_pair_3205:
  - text: do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
  utter_qa_pair_3206:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_3207:
  - text: i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples,
      and the oranges.
  utter_qa_pair_3208:
  - text: did you go to the 99 cents store?
  utter_qa_pair_3209:
  - text: yes, i did.
  utter_qa_pair_3210:
  - text: what did you buy?
  utter_qa_pair_3211:
  - text: well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual.
  utter_qa_pair_3212:
  - text: like what?
  utter_qa_pair_3213:
  - text: well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
  utter_qa_pair_3214:
  - text: that's a good deal.
  utter_qa_pair_3215:
  - text: and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
  utter_qa_pair_3216:
  - text: another good deal.
  utter_qa_pair_3217:
  - text: but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
  utter_qa_pair_3218:
  - text: i don't know how that store makes money.
  utter_qa_pair_3219:
  - text: i need a new computer.
  utter_qa_pair_3220:
  - text: what's the matter with yours?
  utter_qa_pair_3221:
  - text: it's six years old.
  utter_qa_pair_3222:
  - text: that's pretty old.
  utter_qa_pair_3223:
  - text: it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity.
  utter_qa_pair_3224:
  - text: are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
  utter_qa_pair_3225:
  - text: oh, a laptop, of course.
  utter_qa_pair_3226:
  - text: a pc or a mac?
  utter_qa_pair_3227:
  - text: i haven't decided yet.
  utter_qa_pair_3228:
  - text: more and more people are using macs.
  utter_qa_pair_3229:
  - text: but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.
  utter_qa_pair_3230:
  - text: i got ripped off.
  utter_qa_pair_3231:
  - text: what happened?
  utter_qa_pair_3232:
  - text: i had a car problem, so i went online.
  utter_qa_pair_3233:
  - text: did you find a solution?
  utter_qa_pair_3234:
  - text: yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution.
  utter_qa_pair_3235:
  - text: so, what's the problem?
  utter_qa_pair_3236:
  - text: i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
  utter_qa_pair_3237:
  - text: what are you going to do?
  utter_qa_pair_3238:
  - text: i sent them an email asking for my money back.
  utter_qa_pair_3239:
  - text: have you heard from them?
  utter_qa_pair_3240:
  - text: not yet. it's been a week.
  utter_qa_pair_3241:
  - text: where's the pencil sharpener?
  utter_qa_pair_3242:
  - text: which one?
  utter_qa_pair_3243:
  - text: any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.
  utter_qa_pair_3244:
  - text: i think there's one on the dining room table.
  utter_qa_pair_3245:
  - text: i already looked there.
  utter_qa_pair_3246:
  - text: did you look in the desk drawer?
  utter_qa_pair_3247:
  - text: yes, i looked there, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3248:
  - text: don't we have about five sharpeners?
  utter_qa_pair_3249:
  - text: yes, but they seem to have legs.
  utter_qa_pair_3250:
  - text: tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
  utter_qa_pair_3251:
  - text: get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
  utter_qa_pair_3252:
  - text: i'm trying to stretch my dollars.
  utter_qa_pair_3253:
  - text: how are you doing that?
  utter_qa_pair_3254:
  - text: i started shopping at the dollar store.
  utter_qa_pair_3255:
  - text: that saves a lot of money.
  utter_qa_pair_3256:
  - text: i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
  utter_qa_pair_3257:
  - text: that's a good deal.
  utter_qa_pair_3258:
  - text: yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_3259:
  - text: just put them in the fridge.
  utter_qa_pair_3260:
  - text: also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
  utter_qa_pair_3261:
  - text: why did you do that?
  utter_qa_pair_3262:
  - text: i mixed them together.
  utter_qa_pair_3263:
  - text: i really like this house.
  utter_qa_pair_3264:
  - text: can we afford it?
  utter_qa_pair_3265:
  - text: they want 20 percent down.
  utter_qa_pair_3266:
  - text: that's a lot of money.
  utter_qa_pair_3267:
  - text: but the house is so nice.
  utter_qa_pair_3268:
  - text: it's in a great neighborhood.
  utter_qa_pair_3269:
  - text: it's close to the beach.
  utter_qa_pair_3270:
  - text: it's close to the freeways.
  utter_qa_pair_3271:
  - text: it's got a big yard.
  utter_qa_pair_3272:
  - text: the kids love the house, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3273:
  - text: if we don't buy it, someone else will.
  utter_qa_pair_3274:
  - text: we can't afford this house.
  utter_qa_pair_3275:
  - text: are you sure?
  utter_qa_pair_3276:
  - text: we will be house rich, but cash poor.
  utter_qa_pair_3277:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_3278:
  - text: our monthly payments will be too high.
  utter_qa_pair_3279:
  - text: we won't have any money for other things?
  utter_qa_pair_3280:
  - text: no, we won't have money for gas or food.
  utter_qa_pair_3281:
  - text: we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
  utter_qa_pair_3282:
  - text: without the peanut butter!
  utter_qa_pair_3283:
  - text: that's no good!
  utter_qa_pair_3284:
  - text: we have to find a cheaper house.
  utter_qa_pair_3285:
  - text: that is a beautiful house.
  utter_qa_pair_3286:
  - text: i don't like it.
  utter_qa_pair_3287:
  - text: what's the matter with it?
  utter_qa_pair_3288:
  - text: it's on the corner.
  utter_qa_pair_3289:
  - text: so?
  utter_qa_pair_3290:
  - text: that means it gets twice as much traffic.
  utter_qa_pair_3291:
  - text: you're right.
  utter_qa_pair_3292:
  - text: when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the
      intersection.
  utter_qa_pair_3293:
  - text: or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
  utter_qa_pair_3294:
  - text: or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
  utter_qa_pair_3295:
  - text: let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
  utter_qa_pair_3296:
  - text: i hate looking for an apartment.
  utter_qa_pair_3297:
  - text: me, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3298:
  - text: we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.
  utter_qa_pair_3299:
  - text: we'd better get ready to go.
  utter_qa_pair_3300:
  - text: it's an upstairs unit.
  utter_qa_pair_3301:
  - text: that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet.
  utter_qa_pair_3302:
  - text: and it's a corner unit.
  utter_qa_pair_3303:
  - text: that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
  utter_qa_pair_3304:
  - text: no pets are allowed.
  utter_qa_pair_3305:
  - text: perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.
  utter_qa_pair_3306:
  - text: and there are only six units in the whole building.
  utter_qa_pair_3307:
  - text: did you call the manager?
  utter_qa_pair_3308:
  - text: yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.
  utter_qa_pair_3309:
  - text: did he say what time?
  utter_qa_pair_3310:
  - text: yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
  utter_qa_pair_3311:
  - text: did he understand what the problem is?
  utter_qa_pair_3312:
  - text: yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.
  utter_qa_pair_3313:
  - text: it shouldn't take him long to fix it.
  utter_qa_pair_3314:
  - text: i don't even know why we need to fix it.
  utter_qa_pair_3315:
  - text: in case we have visitors.
  utter_qa_pair_3316:
  - text: but they can just knock on the door.
  utter_qa_pair_3317:
  - text: actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3318:
  - text: do you like this house?
  utter_qa_pair_3319:
  - text: yes, it's beautiful.
  utter_qa_pair_3320:
  - text: it's perfect for us and the kids.
  utter_qa_pair_3321:
  - text: three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.
  utter_qa_pair_3322:
  - text: and we can afford it!
  utter_qa_pair_3323:
  - text: so are we going to buy it?
  utter_qa_pair_3324:
  - text: i'm afraid not.
  utter_qa_pair_3325:
  - text: it's too far from your job, isn't it?
  utter_qa_pair_3326:
  - text: i can't spend four hours on the road every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3327:
  - text: by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.
  utter_qa_pair_3328:
  - text: i won't be able to play with the kids.
  utter_qa_pair_3329:
  - text: boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?
  utter_qa_pair_3330:
  - text: it sure is.
  utter_qa_pair_3331:
  - text: in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3332:
  - text: let's turn on the heat.
  utter_qa_pair_3333:
  - text: i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
  utter_qa_pair_3334:
  - text: it should be warmer in a few minutes.
  utter_qa_pair_3335:
  - text: it's so nice to have a heated apartment.
  utter_qa_pair_3336:
  - text: how did they survive in the old days?
  utter_qa_pair_3337:
  - text: they had fireplaces.
  utter_qa_pair_3338:
  - text: someone had to chop the wood.
  utter_qa_pair_3339:
  - text: and carry it into the house.
  utter_qa_pair_3340:
  - text: this is a nice neighborhood.
  utter_qa_pair_3341:
  - text: the streets are clean and quiet.
  utter_qa_pair_3342:
  - text: the neighbors don't party on the weekends.
  utter_qa_pair_3343:
  - text: people take care of their lawns.
  utter_qa_pair_3344:
  - text: no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
  utter_qa_pair_3345:
  - text: we never have to call the police about anything.
  utter_qa_pair_3346:
  - text: our kids are completely safe.
  utter_qa_pair_3347:
  - text: so why are we selling our house?
  utter_qa_pair_3348:
  - text: they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
  utter_qa_pair_3349:
  - text: so we've got to sell before property values go down?
  utter_qa_pair_3350:
  - text: yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
  utter_qa_pair_3351:
  - text: that was a huge fire in santa barbara.
  utter_qa_pair_3352:
  - text: yes, it was.
  utter_qa_pair_3353:
  - text: they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
  utter_qa_pair_3354:
  - text: and they were expensive houses.
  utter_qa_pair_3355:
  - text: i feel so sorry for those people.
  utter_qa_pair_3356:
  - text: why feel sorry for rich people?
  utter_qa_pair_3357:
  - text: i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
  utter_qa_pair_3358:
  - text: so do i, but not if they're rich.
  utter_qa_pair_3359:
  - text: what does that have to do with it?
  utter_qa_pair_3360:
  - text: rich people think they're better than us.
  utter_qa_pair_3361:
  - text: how many rich people do you know?
  utter_qa_pair_3362:
  - text: bears are invading our neighborhoods.
  utter_qa_pair_3363:
  - text: of course they are. they're starving to death.
  utter_qa_pair_3364:
  - text: they should stay in the woods where they belong.
  utter_qa_pair_3365:
  - text: there's no food in the woods.
  utter_qa_pair_3366:
  - text: can't they eat grass?
  utter_qa_pair_3367:
  - text: do you think a bear is a cow?
  utter_qa_pair_3368:
  - text: well, i've seen them eating berries.
  utter_qa_pair_3369:
  - text: berries aren't in season all year round.
  utter_qa_pair_3370:
  - text: it's too dangerous for kids and pets.
  utter_qa_pair_3371:
  - text: people need to cover their trash cans.
  utter_qa_pair_3372:
  - text: the police need to shoot all the bears.
  utter_qa_pair_3373:
  - text: who did you vote for?
  utter_qa_pair_3374:
  - text: i voted for obama.
  utter_qa_pair_3375:
  - text: me too.
  utter_qa_pair_3376:
  - text: he will be a great president.
  utter_qa_pair_3377:
  - text: everyone likes him.
  utter_qa_pair_3378:
  - text: he's a good speaker.
  utter_qa_pair_3379:
  - text: and he's really smart.
  utter_qa_pair_3380:
  - text: he will solve our problems.
  utter_qa_pair_3381:
  - text: he will end the war.
  utter_qa_pair_3382:
  - text: the next four years will be good years.
  utter_qa_pair_3383:
  - text: i'll vote for him next time, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3384:
  - text: the election is next week.
  utter_qa_pair_3385:
  - text: who are you voting for?
  utter_qa_pair_3386:
  - text: i'm not voting for the mayor.
  utter_qa_pair_3387:
  - text: why not?
  utter_qa_pair_3388:
  - text: he made promises that he didn't keep.
  utter_qa_pair_3389:
  - text: like what?
  utter_qa_pair_3390:
  - text: he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.
  utter_qa_pair_3391:
  - text: how many did he hire?
  utter_qa_pair_3392:
  - text: one hundred!
  utter_qa_pair_3393:
  - text: maybe he had a good reason.
  utter_qa_pair_3394:
  - text: maybe he's just a liar.
  utter_qa_pair_3395:
  - text: i can't believe he won the election.
  utter_qa_pair_3396:
  - text: only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
  utter_qa_pair_3397:
  - text: that is a joke.
  utter_qa_pair_3398:
  - text: voting is so important, but people don't bother.
  utter_qa_pair_3399:
  - text: many people think their vote doesn't matter.
  utter_qa_pair_3400:
  - text: the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.
  utter_qa_pair_3401:
  - text: we're stuck with him for four more years.
  utter_qa_pair_3402:
  - text: voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.
  utter_qa_pair_3403:
  - text: all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
  utter_qa_pair_3404:
  - text: how easy is that?
  utter_qa_pair_3405:
  - text: i guess people just don't care.
  utter_qa_pair_3406:
  - text: well, we have a new president.
  utter_qa_pair_3407:
  - text: but we have the same old problems.
  utter_qa_pair_3408:
  - text: well, he's made a few changes.
  utter_qa_pair_3409:
  - text: like what?
  utter_qa_pair_3410:
  - text: i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.
  utter_qa_pair_3411:
  - text: oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.
  utter_qa_pair_3412:
  - text: who's paying for that?
  utter_qa_pair_3413:
  - text: i think we are!
  utter_qa_pair_3414:
  - text: well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
  utter_qa_pair_3415:
  - text: yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.
  utter_qa_pair_3416:
  - text: do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
  utter_qa_pair_3417:
  - text: people say that everybody loves obama.
  utter_qa_pair_3418:
  - text: well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.
  utter_qa_pair_3419:
  - text: that's 50 million people who don't love obama.
  utter_qa_pair_3420:
  - text: obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
  utter_qa_pair_3421:
  - text: he's never going to make everyone happy.
  utter_qa_pair_3422:
  - text: can you imagine being president?
  utter_qa_pair_3423:
  - text: everyone wants you to solve their problems.
  utter_qa_pair_3424:
  - text: i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
  utter_qa_pair_3425:
  - text: you and everybody else.
  utter_qa_pair_3426:
  - text: i would never want to be president.
  utter_qa_pair_3427:
  - text: but think about all the power you'd have.
  utter_qa_pair_3428:
  - text: did you read this article?
  utter_qa_pair_3429:
  - text: what article?
  utter_qa_pair_3430:
  - text: it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
  utter_qa_pair_3431:
  - text: only 11 percent?
  utter_qa_pair_3432:
  - text: about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
  utter_qa_pair_3433:
  - text: where does he travel to?
  utter_qa_pair_3434:
  - text: oh, all over the world.
  utter_qa_pair_3435:
  - text: but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
  utter_qa_pair_3436:
  - text: he's visiting other cities to get ideas.
  utter_qa_pair_3437:
  - text: can't he just go online?
  utter_qa_pair_3438:
  - text: the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
  utter_qa_pair_3439:
  - text: who did you vote for for president?
  utter_qa_pair_3440:
  - text: i voted for ralph nader.
  utter_qa_pair_3441:
  - text: who in the world is ralph nader?
  utter_qa_pair_3442:
  - text: he's the best man for president.
  utter_qa_pair_3443:
  - text: why's that?
  utter_qa_pair_3444:
  - text: he hates corporations.
  utter_qa_pair_3445:
  - text: well, most corporations do think only about money.
  utter_qa_pair_3446:
  - text: he hates democrats and republicans.
  utter_qa_pair_3447:
  - text: well, they do put their party before their country.
  utter_qa_pair_3448:
  - text: he's the only candidate that i trust.
  utter_qa_pair_3449:
  - text: but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!
  utter_qa_pair_3450:
  - text: i don't know why i bother to vote.
  utter_qa_pair_3451:
  - text: why's that?
  utter_qa_pair_3452:
  - text: what good does it do?
  utter_qa_pair_3453:
  - text: you get to put someone in power that you like.
  utter_qa_pair_3454:
  - text: only if my candidate wins.
  utter_qa_pair_3455:
  - text: well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.
  utter_qa_pair_3456:
  - text: but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.
  utter_qa_pair_3457:
  - text: that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.
  utter_qa_pair_3458:
  - text: and when elected, they go their own way.
  utter_qa_pair_3459:
  - text: they forget who put them in power.
  utter_qa_pair_3460:
  - text: they forget where they came from.
  utter_qa_pair_3461:
  - text: that election for u.s. senator stunk.
  utter_qa_pair_3462:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_3463:
  - text: there were more votes than voters!
  utter_qa_pair_3464:
  - text: but that's impossible.
  utter_qa_pair_3465:
  - text: officials said that it's possible.
  utter_qa_pair_3466:
  - text: did they explain how it's possible?
  utter_qa_pair_3467:
  - text: no. they said there are some things you can't explain.
  utter_qa_pair_3468:
  - text: so are they going to hold another election?
  utter_qa_pair_3469:
  - text: no. that will cost too much money.
  utter_qa_pair_3470:
  - text: so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
  utter_qa_pair_3471:
  - text: well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.
  utter_qa_pair_3472:
  - text: i see that former president bush is at a conference.
  utter_qa_pair_3473:
  - text: yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
  utter_qa_pair_3474:
  - text: yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
  utter_qa_pair_3475:
  - text: only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.
  utter_qa_pair_3476:
  - text: not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
  utter_qa_pair_3477:
  - text: but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
  utter_qa_pair_3478:
  - text: that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
  utter_qa_pair_3479:
  - text: he spoke to them and made them feel better.
  utter_qa_pair_3480:
  - text: did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
  utter_qa_pair_3481:
  - text: no, he didn't have time to do that.
  utter_qa_pair_3482:
  - text: well, he's got plenty of time now!
  utter_qa_pair_3483:
  - text: did you get your official sample ballot?
  utter_qa_pair_3484:
  - text: yes, with the voter instructions.
  utter_qa_pair_3485:
  - text: how are you going to vote?
  utter_qa_pair_3486:
  - text: same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
  utter_qa_pair_3487:
  - text: i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
  utter_qa_pair_3488:
  - text: against all of them, of course.
  utter_qa_pair_3489:
  - text: but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
  utter_qa_pair_3490:
  - text: we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
  utter_qa_pair_3491:
  - text: that's true. where did that money go?
  utter_qa_pair_3492:
  - text: our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
  utter_qa_pair_3493:
  - text: they are having a good time with our money.
  utter_qa_pair_3494:
  - text: have you decided how you are going to vote?
  utter_qa_pair_3495:
  - text: do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?
  utter_qa_pair_3496:
  - text: yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
  utter_qa_pair_3497:
  - text: you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
  utter_qa_pair_3498:
  - text: but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
  utter_qa_pair_3499:
  - text: do you believe the tv ads?
  utter_qa_pair_3500:
  - text: i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.
  utter_qa_pair_3501:
  - text: don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true.
  utter_qa_pair_3502:
  - text: but the title of measure 1 is "better schools at no cost."
  utter_qa_pair_3503:
  - text: the title should be "better schools at huge cost."
  utter_qa_pair_3504:
  - text: i can't believe that they would lie to us.
  utter_qa_pair_3505:
  - text: i have a stomachache.
  utter_qa_pair_3506:
  - text: is it something you ate?
  utter_qa_pair_3507:
  - text: maybe. i'm not sure.
  utter_qa_pair_3508:
  - text: what did you have for breakfast?
  utter_qa_pair_3509:
  - text: the usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
  utter_qa_pair_3510:
  - text: maybe the milk was bad.
  utter_qa_pair_3511:
  - text: it didn't smell bad.
  utter_qa_pair_3512:
  - text: maybe the banana was bad.
  utter_qa_pair_3513:
  - text: no, the banana was delicious.
  utter_qa_pair_3514:
  - text: maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
  utter_qa_pair_3515:
  - text: no, that's not the problem.
  utter_qa_pair_3516:
  - text: what's this stain?
  utter_qa_pair_3517:
  - text: i don't know.
  utter_qa_pair_3518:
  - text: it looks like blood.
  utter_qa_pair_3519:
  - text: i think my nose was bleeding.
  utter_qa_pair_3520:
  - text: you should wet your shirt immediately.
  utter_qa_pair_3521:
  - text: why?
  utter_qa_pair_3522:
  - text: because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
  utter_qa_pair_3523:
  - text: what's a little blood?
  utter_qa_pair_3524:
  - text: your white shirt is ruined.
  utter_qa_pair_3525:
  - text: so, i'll just buy another one.
  utter_qa_pair_3526:
  - text: you can wear this one around the house.
  utter_qa_pair_3527:
  - text: my fingers hurt.
  utter_qa_pair_3528:
  - text: why do they hurt?
  utter_qa_pair_3529:
  - text: i type too much.
  utter_qa_pair_3530:
  - text: you should take a break.
  utter_qa_pair_3531:
  - text: i need to type to make money.
  utter_qa_pair_3532:
  - text: but typing is causing you pain.
  utter_qa_pair_3533:
  - text: maybe i should see a doctor.
  utter_qa_pair_3534:
  - text: doctors are too expensive.
  utter_qa_pair_3535:
  - text: he might tell me to rest for a while.
  utter_qa_pair_3536:
  - text: he might want to cut you open.
  utter_qa_pair_3537:
  - text: he might say i'm okay.
  utter_qa_pair_3538:
  - text: what did the doctor say?
  utter_qa_pair_3539:
  - text: he thinks i have too much stress.
  utter_qa_pair_3540:
  - text: stress causes your stomachaches?
  utter_qa_pair_3541:
  - text: stress causes different problems with different people.
  utter_qa_pair_3542:
  - text: so what did he tell you to do?
  utter_qa_pair_3543:
  - text: he said i need to think positive.
  utter_qa_pair_3544:
  - text: he didn't give you any medication?
  utter_qa_pair_3545:
  - text: i hate medication. it makes me feel different.
  utter_qa_pair_3546:
  - text: so how do you think positive?
  utter_qa_pair_3547:
  - text: i think about nice things.
  utter_qa_pair_3548:
  - text: like what?
  utter_qa_pair_3549:
  - text: i cut my finger.
  utter_qa_pair_3550:
  - text: how did you do that?
  utter_qa_pair_3551:
  - text: it's a paper cut.
  utter_qa_pair_3552:
  - text: paper can be dangerous.
  utter_qa_pair_3553:
  - text: it hurts, too.
  utter_qa_pair_3554:
  - text: paper cuts can hurt a lot.
  utter_qa_pair_3555:
  - text: where are the band-aids?
  utter_qa_pair_3556:
  - text: i think they're in the medicine cabinet.
  utter_qa_pair_3557:
  - text: it's on the tip of my finger.
  utter_qa_pair_3558:
  - text: a band-aid might not work.
  utter_qa_pair_3559:
  - text: i must not use this finger until the cut heals.
  utter_qa_pair_3560:
  - text: do you smell that?
  utter_qa_pair_3561:
  - text: oh, yes.
  utter_qa_pair_3562:
  - text: i can't stand cigarette smoke.
  utter_qa_pair_3563:
  - text: it smells so bad.
  utter_qa_pair_3564:
  - text: one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
  utter_qa_pair_3565:
  - text: smokers think they are so cool.
  utter_qa_pair_3566:
  - text: they are so weak.
  utter_qa_pair_3567:
  - text: a little cigarette controls them.
  utter_qa_pair_3568:
  - text: they look so stupid taking a puff.
  utter_qa_pair_3569:
  - text: and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
  utter_qa_pair_3570:
  - text: they think it's cool.
  utter_qa_pair_3571:
  - text: do you have a cold?
  utter_qa_pair_3572:
  - text: yes, i do.
  utter_qa_pair_3573:
  - text: how did you get it?
  utter_qa_pair_3574:
  - text: my sister had a cold. she gave it to me.
  utter_qa_pair_3575:
  - text: have you taken anything for your cold?
  utter_qa_pair_3576:
  - text: no, i just blow my nose a lot.
  utter_qa_pair_3577:
  - text: your nose is stopped up?
  utter_qa_pair_3578:
  - text: yes. i have to breathe through my mouth.
  utter_qa_pair_3579:
  - text: have you tried nose drops?
  utter_qa_pair_3580:
  - text: no, i don't like nose drops.
  utter_qa_pair_3581:
  - text: they work great.
  utter_qa_pair_3582:
  - text: would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?
  utter_qa_pair_3583:
  - text: sure.
  utter_qa_pair_3584:
  - text: thank you.
  utter_qa_pair_3585:
  - text: you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
  utter_qa_pair_3586:
  - text: i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.
  utter_qa_pair_3587:
  - text: what's wrong with looking pale?
  utter_qa_pair_3588:
  - text: people think you might be sick.
  utter_qa_pair_3589:
  - text: who thinks that?
  utter_qa_pair_3590:
  - text: i don't know.
  utter_qa_pair_3591:
  - text: it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
  utter_qa_pair_3592:
  - text: i know that.
  utter_qa_pair_3593:
  - text: i can't quit smoking.
  utter_qa_pair_3594:
  - text: of course you can.
  utter_qa_pair_3595:
  - text: i don't have enough will power.
  utter_qa_pair_3596:
  - text: of course you do.
  utter_qa_pair_3597:
  - text: i wish i had never started.
  utter_qa_pair_3598:
  - text: so does every smoker.
  utter_qa_pair_3599:
  - text: i've tried to quit so many times.
  utter_qa_pair_3600:
  - text: so has everyone else.
  utter_qa_pair_3601:
  - text: nothing seems to work.
  utter_qa_pair_3602:
  - text: all it takes is will power, and you have it.
  utter_qa_pair_3603:
  - text: then why can't i quit?
  utter_qa_pair_3604:
  - text: my back is killing me.
  utter_qa_pair_3605:
  - text: what did you do?
  utter_qa_pair_3606:
  - text: i got out of my car.
  utter_qa_pair_3607:
  - text: that's it?
  utter_qa_pair_3608:
  - text: i injured my back one time just by sneezing.
  utter_qa_pair_3609:
  - text: you should see a doctor.
  utter_qa_pair_3610:
  - text: my doctor said i need surgery.
  utter_qa_pair_3611:
  - text: so?
  utter_qa_pair_3612:
  - text: so, forget it.
  utter_qa_pair_3613:
  - text: you don't have the money?
  utter_qa_pair_3614:
  - text: i have no insurance.
  utter_qa_pair_3615:
  - text: my brother smokes three packs a day.
  utter_qa_pair_3616:
  - text: three packs of what?
  utter_qa_pair_3617:
  - text: cigarettes, of course.
  utter_qa_pair_3618:
  - text: how can he do that?
  utter_qa_pair_3619:
  - text: when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
  utter_qa_pair_3620:
  - text: he's a chain smoker.
  utter_qa_pair_3621:
  - text: he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
  utter_qa_pair_3622:
  - text: that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?
  utter_qa_pair_3623:
  - text: he can, but the people around him can't.
  utter_qa_pair_3624:
  - text: how can he still be alive?
  utter_qa_pair_3625:
  - text: his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
  utter_qa_pair_3626:
  - text: i hate brushing my teeth.
  utter_qa_pair_3627:
  - text: it's such a chore.
  utter_qa_pair_3628:
  - text: brush, brush. spit, spit.
  utter_qa_pair_3629:
  - text: what did they do in the old days?
  utter_qa_pair_3630:
  - text: they brushed with their fingers.
  utter_qa_pair_3631:
  - text: they also ate with their fingers!
  utter_qa_pair_3632:
  - text: why do they call it the good old days?
  utter_qa_pair_3633:
  - text: maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
  utter_qa_pair_3634:
  - text: who invented flossing?
  utter_qa_pair_3635:
  - text: a dentist, i'm sure.
  utter_qa_pair_3636:
  - text: i hate flossing more than brushing!
  utter_qa_pair_3637:
  - text: let's stop for a while. i need a break and some water.
  utter_qa_pair_3638:
  - text: this trail is hard to climb.
  utter_qa_pair_3639:
  - text: especially on a hot day like this.
  utter_qa_pair_3640:
  - text: i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
  utter_qa_pair_3641:
  - text: thank goodness! i don't want to see any wild animals.
  utter_qa_pair_3642:
  - text: all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
  utter_qa_pair_3643:
  - text: we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.
  utter_qa_pair_3644:
  - text: i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.
  utter_qa_pair_3645:
  - text: all you've lost is some sweat.
  utter_qa_pair_3646:
  - text: i haven't even lost one pound of fat?
  utter_qa_pair_3647:
  - text: if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3648:
  - text: oh no, another pimple on my face.
  utter_qa_pair_3649:
  - text: pimples suck.
  utter_qa_pair_3650:
  - text: it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.
  utter_qa_pair_3651:
  - text: maybe it's something in your diet.
  utter_qa_pair_3652:
  - text: no, i eat the same things day after day.
  utter_qa_pair_3653:
  - text: then maybe it's in your genes.
  utter_qa_pair_3654:
  - text: you might be right.
  utter_qa_pair_3655:
  - text: do pimples run in your family?
  utter_qa_pair_3656:
  - text: not that i've noticed.
  utter_qa_pair_3657:
  - text: well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.
  utter_qa_pair_3658:
  - text: whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.
  utter_qa_pair_3659:
  - text: do you believe everything you hear?
  utter_qa_pair_3660:
  - text: i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.
  utter_qa_pair_3661:
  - text: you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.
  utter_qa_pair_3662:
  - text: you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
  utter_qa_pair_3663:
  - text: everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.

  utter_qa_pair_3706:
  - text: what do you mean?
  utter_qa_pair_3707:
  - text: a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
  utter_qa_pair_3708:
  - text: why did they do that?
  utter_qa_pair_3709:
  - text: a mad dog bit most of her face off.
  utter_qa_pair_3710:
  - text: oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now?
  utter_qa_pair_3711:
  - text: her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.

  utter_qa_pair_3717:
  - text: what do you think it is?
  utter_qa_pair_3718:
  - text: i don't know. i think it's old age.
  utter_qa_pair_3719:
  - text: if it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?
  utter_qa_pair_3720:
  - text: that's a good question. maybe it's not old age.
  utter_qa_pair_3721:
  - text: are you right-handed?
  utter_qa_pair_3722:
